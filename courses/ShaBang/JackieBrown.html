The only person that can capture the attitude of Leonard's book is of course Tarantino.</p><hr><p><b>Isaac</b> <a href="mailto:isaacoleary@yahoo.com.au" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/2-stars.gif> (2 out of 10 )<br>I thought this movie was terrible. If you're a Tarantino fan, DO NOT WATCH IT. I've lost a lot of respect for Tarantino because of this film.</p><hr><p><b>Jim Slater</b> <img src=/images/rating/3-stars.gif> (3 out of 10 )<br>Ditto!</p><hr><p><b>Chris</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>Jackie Brown deserves more credit. It may not quite match up to QT's other films in some senses, but Jackie Brown is by far his most mature work. There's still plenty of classic Tarantino-style dialogue and he adapts Elmore Leonard's characters brilliantly to make for a witty and durable film.</p><hr><p><b>Duncan</b> <a href="mailto:duncan.hamilton@hotmail.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>What a remedial class of reviewers. The movie and script were about the character development more than an amazing "mind-blowing" experience.</p><hr><p><b>Ben</b> <a href="mailto:woolzer@hotmail.co.uk" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>You guys that are saying Jackie Brown is a 2 or 3 out of 10 need your heads examined! The dialogue is superb, as is the perfect choice of actors/actresses who are perfect for their roles. I'm a big Tarantino fan and I think this is one of his finest films.</p><hr><p><b>Adam</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I agree with the previous three reviewers. This script was much more character-driven and tells an amazing story. Not only do I think this is Tarantino's best film aside from Pulp Fiction, but it's also one of the greatest films of the last 20 years. Tarantino is one of the greatest screenwriters in the history of cinema, and this script shows off his talents for character development perhaps more so than any of his other films. This is a classic.</p><hr><p><b>Clint Snow</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I think this is the movie that really let people that Tarantino had skill and talent. Jackie Brown isn't as good as Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction, but it's still a very watchable movie just from the little Tarantino directing trademarks.</p><hr><p><b>Menifee Maniac</b> <a href="mailto:tromboneer1@yahoo.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>When Samual Jackson told Chris Rock that he knew an attorney the cops were afraid of; who was better than Johnny Cochran, named "Stasson Goins," Tarintino used a name of a very popular kid from his hometown. Every time I see a Tarantino flick, I am reminiscent about the late 70's and early 80's Era in the South Bay area of L.A. With that background, and an appreciation for Tarintino's street dialogue, Jackie Brown is a classic. That said, it was a terrible waste of Robert De Niro's talents.</p><hr><p><b>Stefano Napolitano</b> <a href="mailto:bronxboys2531@yahoo.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This was an excellent film, and for people who say they lost respect for tarantino just don't know what a good movie is.</p><hr><p><b>OK</b> <img src=/images/rating/7-stars.gif> (7 out of 10 )<br>My least favourite Tarantino film. It's not the worst movie I've seen, but it is the worst Tarantino movie I've seen in my opinon. The diaglogue was good, but that's his forte. It didn't have any distinguishing scenes or motifs that made it stand out like other Quentin Tarantino films. For instance Reservoir dogs had the torture scene to Stuck in the middle with you, Pulp Fiction had the BMF wallet, you know stuff people can easily recognise and go hey that's from___! Sure it had all his usual Quentin things, good music, trunk shot etc. But nothing that people would really remember. Casting and dialogue were great. My least favourite thing in the film was Samuel L. Jackson's facial hair, that braided type goatee made me squirm each time it moved as he spoke! I wanted to grab some scissors and chop it off! That and the sex scene, that was kind of lame. Saying all of this, I did enjoy it.</p><hr><p><b>De Dude</b> <a href="mailto:cesarjss@gmail.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>If this rating is about the script then I would have to go doubtlessly for a 10! It's as good as any other QT stuff and all the goods are there to make it one of the best. Unfortunately the movie is not at such a high level. When I first saw it the pace seemed to slow, but the more I see it now the better it gets to me. I don't know why but this is really happening. Nevertheless the music is as good as ever, some performances do stand out, and the ironic choice of cast does add some laughs.</p><hr><p><b>qt_fan</b> <a href="mailto:yeahbutnobutyeahbutshutup@hotmail.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Yeah sure, it didn't have the action scenes or violence we were expected, but it still has the classic tarantino dialogue, humour and basic, yet artistic cinematography. Great script.</p><hr><p><b>Jesse- Mature Film</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I will agree with a lot of people and say this is not my favorite Tarantino Film. There is a little something amiss, to me it's the characters. Not that they are bad, it's just that some are a little built up better than others. Let us take Samuel L Jackson's character. This bad ass gunrunner is built up perfect, his lines are perfect he connects with his character, as do Pam Grier and Robert Forester (probably why they were all nominated for some sort of acting award that year). But let us move to Robert De Niro's character. He seems so god damned bored, which is a shame because he's a phenomenal actor, same with Mr Keaton - he doesn't seem bored but his character is such a small one. That all being said though, this movie is still top notch. Good solid story, the chemistry between characters are good and of course the dialog is spectacular.</p><hr><p><b>Vrock</b> <a href="mailto:vereswheel@sbcglobal.net" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Q took this underrated book by a quality author and exploded the whole thing over the silver screen. They casted the best actors that could have possibly played each of their respected roles, especially, Pam Grier, my god! That's what Q does with so many of his films, he takes an idea that looks sharp on paper, to those of us who actually read and don't have ADD so we can't focus our minds of written words for five minutes, losers, and turns into a visualization of bliss. Screen shots, dialogue, plot, whatever, every element is always on point when Q's behind the wheel. For those of you who truly don't like this movie and claim to be fans of Q's, you're cheap and sorry excuses for fans.</p><hr><p><b>MOVIE MAX</b> <a href="mailto:clancammie@googlemail.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Jackie Brown is a classic piece of work. It has great dialog and some interesting characters. It is mostly remembered as the QT film with the least violence, which some people liked and others didn't. I thought that it was really cool, and that you don't need any violence to help people to enjoy it. PULP FICTION has to be my favorite because of the classy dialog and action, then JACKIE BROWN. I think that Samuel L. Jackson delivered a great performance, and so did Robert De'Niro.    </p><hr><p><b>jeremy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This is Quentin's love song to the Blaxploitation films of his youth. I'm not some fanboy who loves everything that QT does- hated Reservoir Dogs, for example- but this is an awesome movie. I think what I like best is that nobody acts stupidly or unbelievably: these are real people, who do real things. No fancy car chases, no bloody shootouts where one in a thousand bullets hits the target- here there are only half a dozen shots fired, and they all hit home.</p><hr><p><b>Logan</b> <a href="mailto:lman427@gmail.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>In the movie Jackie Brown, QT does a great job showing what life is like in Compton and how people speak to each other. He does a good job with not only the dialogue, but how one situation leads to the next. This is an outstanding movie and won Pam Grier her first "best actress" award. Although this is probably Quentin Tarantino's least popular film, it is still very famous and many people love it, including me.</p><hr><p><b>Anand Potdar</b> <a href="mailto:anandasasa@rediffmail.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>A gem of cinematic experience. Though quite different from Tarantino's previous works "pulp fiction" and "reservoir dogs", Jackie Brown is a masterpiece in its own way. The flick grows on you and surprises with every scene until a debatable climax (why didn't cherry go with Jackie to Spain?). A superlative entertainment with an enviable script.</p><hr><p><b>Cameron</b> <a href="mailto:darthsitkur@aol.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>I've never seen this and I don't plan to, Quentin Tarantino sucks, he's way too obsessed with his own writing, kill bill part 1 is the only Tarantino film I like.</p><hr><p><b>wiley</b> <a href="mailto:wileyakin@gmail.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>One of De Niro's best performances. Seriously, there's plenty of actors who play domineering hardasses and have no other repertoire than that. De Niro can play that role, or turn around and play a degenerate piece of sh*t like this guy with the same conviction and depth. Definitely one of the most underrated film roles, like, ever. Also, the soundtrack is superb, sampling the scores from a grip of other blaxploitation films as well as other tracks from that era, it's the perfect homage to 1970's pulp film.</p><hr><p><b>Mosai Garcia</b> <a href="mailto:nmosai@yahoo.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Jackie Brown was an amazing film. I think it showed Tarantino can have all his common signature's, the trunk shot, long but interesting scenes, etc. But it also showed Quentin working with something new that he had never done before. A 70's style film. Overall it was good. Not his most popular, but not his worst film.</p><hr><p><b>Harry Lime</b> <a href="mailto:tjfleet@gmail.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>This is Tarantino's most straightforward, most pensive, and least characteristic movie. Its comparative lack of blood-spattering bombast gives it almost a meandering tone in retrospect, but he skilfully subordinates a poignant, socially conscious undertone of Blaxploitation to an entertaining slow heist. It's a long film, but I could watch these characters play off each other self-interestedly all day.</p><hr><p><b>C P S Mike</b> <a href="mailto:acehole3742@gmail.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Not only is this my favorite QT movie, it is also one of my top 20 favorite movies of all time. I have watched it at least five times and it never gets old. It felt a lot more grounded in reality than his other works, but that does not mean boring by any stretch of imagination. The characters and dialog really drive the movie. It exhibited great actors pulling off great performances. Sorry to all of those people missing the blood guysers and black suit wearing gangsters, but you should broaden your horizons and judge this on its own merits for what it is, a cinematic masterpiece.</p><hr></td>
