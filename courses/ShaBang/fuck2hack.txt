<P ID="dia">No problem, Elliot. I'm just hackin' wit ya, that's all. Actually, I'll 
tell you but you gotta keep it quiet. Understand, if Dick didn't assure me 
you're good people I'd just tell ya, none of your hackin' business. But, as 
a sign of good faith, here it goes: I gotta friend in the department.

<P ID="dia">We were in Four H together. We've known each other since childhood. So, I'm 
handling the sales part. He's my silent partner and he knows if I get 
hacked up, I won't drop dime on him. I didn't tell you nothin' and you 
didn't hear nothin'.

<P ID="dia">Riddle me this, Batman. If you're all so much in love with each other, what 
the hack are you doing here? I'm sure you got better things to do with your 
time than walk around in circles starin' up a panther's ass. Your guy's 
interested because with that much shit at his fingertips he can play Joe 
hackin' Hollywood till the wheels come off. He can sell it, he can snort 
it, he can play Santa Claus with it. At the price he's payin', he'll be 
everybody's best friend. And, you know, that's what we're talkin' about

<P ID="dia">He'll talk to you. If after talkin' to you he's convinced you're OK, he'll 
do business. If not, he'll say hack it and walk out the door. He also wants 
a sample bag.

I'm gonna go grab dinner.

<P ID="dia">You think your boyfriend would go through this kind of shit for you? Dream  
on, cunt. You're nothin' but a hackin' fool. And your pretty face is gonna  
turn awful goddamn ugly in about two seconds. Now, where's my hackin' coke?

</p><p><p ID="act">She doesn't answer. He delivers a spinning roundhouse kick on the head. Her head slams into the left side of the wall.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">CLARENCE
<P ID="dia">Like, look at her. She looks like she fell off an ugly tree and hit every  
branch on the way down. Elvis wouldn't hack her with Pat Boone's dick.

</p><p><p ID="act">Clarence and the Customer laugh.

<P ID="dia">You don't have anything to lose.

</p><p><p ID="act">CLOSEUP - Alabama's face. Virgil's right, she doesn't have anything to lose. Virgil's also right about his being the moment of truth. The ferocity in women that comes out at certain times, and is just here under the surface in many women all of the time, is unleashed. The absolute feeling of helplessness she felt only a moment ago has taken a one hundred and eighty degree turn into "I'll take this motherhacker with me if it's the last thing I do" seething hatred.

</p><p><p ID="act">Letting out a bloodcurling yell, she raises the knfe high above her head, then drops to her knees and plunges it deep into Virgil's right foot.

</p><p><P ID="speaker">CLARENCE
<P ID="dia">I feel so horrible about what she went through. That hacker really beat the  
shit out of her. She never told him where I was. It's like I always felt  
that the way she felt about me was a mistake. She couldn't really care that

<P ID="dia">After all I've done for you, you hackin' whore!!

<P ID="dia">But there is a bright side though. If you ever have to play a part of a guy  
who gets hacked in the ass on a daily basis by throat-slitting niggers,  
you'll have so much experience to draw on -

<P ID="dia">'Course you'll wanna hack her in the ass. Pussy just won't feed right  
anymore -

<P ID="dia">Krinkle, this is it. We got it, man. And it's all ours. I mean talk about  
fallin' into somethin'. You shoulda seen it, it was beautiful. Dimes is  
hittin' him from the left about being hacked in the ass by niggers, I'm  
hittin' him form the right about not likin' pussy anymore, finally he  
starts  cryin', and then it was all over -

her wack-a-doo cowboy boyfriend out-aped Virgil. Knowing Virgil, I find  
that hard to believe. But they sent Drexl to hell, and Drexl was no faggot.

couldn't do anythin' about it. I didn't have enough money. It was tough  
enough just tryin' to pay my rent every month, an' here I was livin' next  
to an airport. Whenever I went outside, I saw hackin' planes take off  
drownin' out my show. All day long I'm seein', hearin' people doin' what I  
wanted to do most, but couldn't.

<P ID="dia">Well, Lee, it's like this. You're getting the bargain of a lifetime because  
I don't know what the hack I'm doing. You're used to dealin' with

that, and I could cut it, and I could sell it a little bit at a time, and

a drug dealer. Deal with cut-throat junkies, killers, worry about getting
