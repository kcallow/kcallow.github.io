<b>     INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY
</b>
     A coffee shop somewhere in New Mexico. MICKEY KNOX, his back
     turned to us, is sitting at the counter finishing his meal. We
     hear the PING...BANG...of a pinball machine being played OFF
<b>     SCREEN.
</b>
     MABEL, a waitress, comes over and fills Mickey's coffee cup.

<b>                               MICKEY
</b>                    What kind of pies do you have?

<b>                               MABEL
</b>                    Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.

<b>                               MICKEY
</b>                    Which do you recommend?

<b>                               MABEL
</b>                    The key lime is great, but it's
                    an acquired taste.

<b>                               MICKEY
</b>                    I haven't had a key lime pie in ten
                    years.

<b>                               MABEL
</b>                    When ya had it, did ya like it?

<b>                               MICKEY
</b>                    No, but that don't mean much. I was a
                    completely different person ten years
                    ago. Let's give key lime a day in
                    court. And a large glass of milk.

     Mabel turns to her right.
<b> 
</b><b>                               MABEL
</b>                         (to someone O.S.)
                    Should I make that two pieces?

     CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see for the first time MALLORY KNOX,
     Mickey's wife, sitting on a counter stool next to him. Her back
     is to the camera as well.

<b>                               MALLORY
</b>                    Nada, Rosey.

<b>                               MABEL
</b>                         (annoyed)
                    My name's not Rosey.
                         (points at name tag)
                    It's Mabel.

     Mabel exits FRAME.

<b>                               MALLORY
</b>                    Whatever.

     Mallory hops from the stool, walks over and grabs the JAR next
     to the cash register, then dumping out the coins on the counter,
     she selects a quarter.

<b>                               MABEL
</b>                    Hey, what the hell do you think you're
                    doin'?

     Mallory saunters past the COWBOY playing pinball. As his eyes
     follow Mallory, he loses his ball.

     She walks to the jukebox in the back, inserts the quarter,
     selects a song, punches the buttons, a needle lands on a record,
     and a good God almighty rockabilly tune cuts through the coffee
     shop.

     Mabel brings Mickey his pie and milk.

<b>                               MABEL
</b>                         (to Mickey)
                    She ought not be doing that. That's
                    for Jerry's kids, not rock 'n roll.

     CAMERA moves around to a CU of Mickey. This is the first time
     we see him. As he takes a bite of green pie:

<b>                               MICKEY
</b>                    I can't take her anywhere.

     Mallory starts doing a slow seductive fandango around the coffee
     shop. She's really cooking and smoking.

     Pinball Cowboy and Mabel are starting to wonder just who the
     hell these people are.

     Mickey isn't paying much attention. He's too busy enjoying his
     pie and milk.

<b>     EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY
</b>
     A dirty pickup truck, sporting a Confederate flag decal, pulls
     up to the coffee shop. SONNY, OTIS, and EARL, three
     tough-looking rednecks, pile out. Steam rises from beneath the
     pickup's hood.

<b>                               EARL
</b>                    Goddamn this sumbitch is runnin' hot.
                    Y'all go inside. I'm gonna check 'er
                    out.

<b>     INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY
</b>
     The LOUDNESS of the Rockabilly song slaps Sonny and Otis in
     their faces as they walk inside the door. The sexy sight of
     Mallory doing the ubang stomp stops them in their tracks.

<b>                               SONNY
</b>                    Good God almighty. What the hell is
                    that?

<b>                               OTIS
</b>                    That's a bitch outta hell, son.

     Otis and Sonny exchange looks.

<b>                               SONNY
</b>                    Take a run at 'er, kiddo.

     Otis heads toward Mallory. Sonny moves over to the counter next
     to Mickey.

<b>                               SONNY
</b>                    Miller, Mabel.

<b>                               MABEL
</b>                    Comin' up.

     Otis stands in front of Mallory, trying to copy what she's
     doing. Her eyes are closed at the moment, so she doesn't see
     him.

     Mabel sets the Miller down in front of Sonny. Sonny takes a
     swig, enjoying the floor show.

<b>                               SONNY
</b>                         (to Mickey)
                    That's some sweet piece of meat, ain't
                    it?

     Mickey turns from his pie and looks at Sonny. His expression
     betrays nothing.

<b>                               MICKEY
</b>                    Her name's Mallory.

     The needle lifts off the record. The song ends.

     Mallory opens her eyes and sees Otis.

<b>                               OTIS
</b>                    Hells Bells! Don't stop now sugar.
                    I'm just getting warmed up.

     Otis gives her his best shit-eating grin before turning to
     Sonny.

     Sonny gurgles out a laugh.

<b>                               SONNY
</b>                    Hey, I think she's sweet on you.

     Otis turns to Mallory as she PUNCHES him hard in the face
     spinning him around.

     Sonny spews his mouthful of Highlife.

     Mallory grabs the back of Otis' head and SMASHES it down on the
     table, cracking the linoleum.

     Otis buckles, dropping to his knees.

     Sonny jumps off the counter stool, but Mickey's hand clutches
     hold of his shoulder.

     Sonny spins around toward Mickey, loaded for bear, and points
     his finger at him, threateningly.

     Before any threat can be made, Mickey whips a large buck knife
     out from its sheath, and in a flash, SLICES off Sonny's finger.

     Sonny's finger drops on his boot. He grabs his aching hand.
     Blood flows from the wound.

<b>                               MICKEY
</b>                    Just because my woman's mopping up the
                    floor with your buddy is no reason for
                    you to join in.

     Mickey makes five lightning quick SLASHING SWINGS. The buck
     knife slips back into its sheath. At first, there seems to be
     no difference with Sonny. Finally, blood flows from the slices
     made in his face and chest. Sonny collapses.

     The SHORT-ORDER COOK charges out of the kitchen at Mickey,
     wielding a meat cleaver and screaming.

     Mickey whips out a .45 automatic from a shoulder holster inside
     his jacket and FIRES.

     BULLET'S POV: Heading fast toward Short-Order Cook's face. It
     HITS. Short-Order Cook puts his hands to his face and falls to
     the ground, screaming.

     Mickey spots Earl, who's standing outside the plate glass
     window. Earl's watched the whole shebang.

     Earl mouths 'Fuck!' He turns and runs for it.

     Mickey hurls the knife through the plate glass window, which
     SHATTERS. The knife PLUNGES deep into Earls back. He hits the
     ground dead.

     Mickey turns to Mallory. She's sitting on op of Otis, SLAMMING
     his head repeatedly on the floor.

<b>                               MICKEY
</b>                    Honey.

     Mallory looks up at Mickey. She gets off Otis and moves to
     Mickey's side.

     Mickey trains his .45 on Pinball Cowboy, who's shaking in his
     cowboy boots. Mickey aims at Mabel, who's clutching the coffee
     pot, crying.

<b>                               MICKEY
</b>                         (to Mallory)
                    Pick one.

     Mallory does eanie, meanie, minie, moe, pointing back and forth
     from Mabel to Pinball Cowboy.

<b>                               MALLORY
</b>                    Eanie, meanie, minie, moe, catch a
                    nigger by the tow. If he hollers, let
                    him go. Eanie, meanie, minie, moe. My
                    mom told me to pick the best one and
                    you are it.

     She ends, pointing at Mabel. Mabel's crying. She screams.

<b>                               MABEL
</b><b>                    NO!
</b>
     Mickey FIRES the .45. The bullet CHINKS through the coffee pot
     Mabel's holding and explodes, THUNKING her in the chest. She
     hits the floor dead.

     Mickey and Mallory join hands and walk over to the Pinball
     Cowboy who stands in a pool of his own urine.

<b>                               MALLORY
</b>                    When you tell people what went on here,
                    tell 'em Mickey and Mallory Knox did
                    this. Understand?

     Pinball Cowboy nods yes.

     The two killers plant a big wet kiss on each other's mouths.
     Then, holding hands, Mickey and Mallory walk out of the cafe.

<b>     INT. POLICE STATION (SQUERI'S OFFICE) - DAY
</b>
     CAMERA is position in the middle of the office. The door is in
     the middle of the frame.

     JACK SCAGNETTI flings the door open and steps inside Squeri's
     office. Squeri's never seen.

<b>                               SCAGNETTI
</b>                    You wanted to see me, Capt'n?

                    You're gonna deliver two prisoners from
                    the county jail to Nystrom Insane
                    Asylum in Bakersfield.

<b>                               SCAGNETTI
</b>                    This is bullshit. I'm a detective.
                    You want an errand boy, call Jerry
                    Lewis.

     Scagnetti spins around and leaves the room, SLAMMING the door
     shut behind him. Captain Squeri shouts after him.

<b>                               CAPTAIN SQUERI (O.S.)
</b>                    Jack!

<b>     INT. POLICE STATION CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
     Police Detective Scagnetti walks rapidly down the hallway,
     wearing an old, wrinkly, black suit jacket.

     PEOPLE walk by in the F.G. and B.G. Scagnetti slips an already
     tied tie over his head.

<b>     INT. INTERROGATION ROOM C - DAY
</b>
     DEWIGHT MCCLUSKY, a man in his fifties, wearing a business suit,
     stands in the F.G. reading a book with his back to the door.
     In the B.G., Scagnetti enters the room.

<b>                               SCAGNETTI
</b>                    Jack Scagnetti. You wanted to see me?

     McClusky turns toward Scagnetti.

<b>                               MCCLUSKY
</b>                    Congratulations on the Curtis Fox case,

                    nightmare. The ladies of this city can
                    get to sleep again, and they have you
                    to thank.

<b>                               SCAGNETTI

                    Prison Board. Take a seat please.

     Scagnetti lowers into a chair in front of the interrogation
     table.

<b>                               MCCLUSKY
</b>                         (referring to book)

                    This would make a better movie than
                    that 'Serpico' shit.

     McClusky puts the book down, we see the title: 'CURTIS FOX: The
     Capture and Death of a Serial Killer'. Author: Jack Scagnetti.
     McClusky sits on the edge of the table, facing Scagnetti. He
     lifts a file off the table, then tosses it in Scagnetti's lap.

<b>                               MCCLUSKY
</b>                    I think you'll find that good reading
                    as well. Mickey and Mallory's file.
                    You familiar with them?

     Scagnetti opens it. It's the files, reports, and photographs
     of Mickey and Mallory Knox. Scagnetti's face lights up.

<b>                               SCAGNETTI

<b>                               MCCLUSKY

     McClusky grabs Scagnetti's book and reads from the back cover.

     file in our hands. It contains her picture and lists her color
     of hair, color of eyes, height, weight, race, etc. Beneath that
     is a column which reads: PSYCHIATRIC REMARKS.

                    Wayne Gayle!

<b>     INT. JAIL - VISITING AREA - DAY
</b>
     WAYNE GAYLE, a young, energetic, commando journalist a'la
     Geraldo Rivera is sitting on the visitor side of the county jail
     visiting area. Wayne is alone and the visiting area is empty.
     Apparently some arrangement was made for the visit. Wayne has a
     miniature tape recorder in his hand and is testing it.

<b>                               WAYNE
</b>                         (into recorder)
                    Testing one...two...three...
                    testing...one...three...over,
                    over, over, Mickey Knox meeting.

     Wayne shuts off the recorder, rewinds and plays it back. It
     works beautifully. He hits the record button and conceals the
     recorder in his sport coat jacket.

     The door opens on the prisoner side and Mickey Knox is lead into
     the room by two SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES. Mickey's wearing the country
     jail blue jump-suit. He has a thick and wide leather belt around
     his waist with a metal ring built into each side. Long sturdy
     chains with handcuffs on each end are wrapped across his body
     and through the rings, binding his arms to his sides. His hands
     and feet are double cuffed.

     The Deputies both have their guns drawn, ready to blow Mickey in
     half at the slightest provocation. For a man wrapped and bound
     in chains, Mickey seems strangely in control of his environment.
     Even restrained as he is by the symbols of society (the chains,
     jail, guards, guns, jump-suit), he remains a dangerous,
     intimidating, and fascinating figure.

     Wayne takes in the image of Mickey.

     Mickey's roughly shoved into his seat on the prisoner's side of
     the glass. The Deputies move to their place, off to the side by
     the wall.

<b>                               WAYNE

                    I feel it's apparent to anyone who's
                    hip to what's going on that the prison
                    board has thrown the constitution
                    straight out the fuckin' window.
                    You and Mallory may be killers, but
                    you're not insane. You belong in a
                    prison, not in an asylum. The prison
                    board is blatantly railroading you into
                    a hospital for the sole purpose of
                    turning you into vegetables. Now some
                    people are saying, 'So what?' I am not
                    one of those people. If we avert our
                    eyes while they do this to you, we give
                    them permission to do it again whenever
                    they see fit. Today they wipe clean
                    your mind because they feel your
                    actions are dangerous, tomorrow they
                    wipe clean my mind because they feel
                    what I say is dangerous. Where does
                    it all stop?

     No response from Mickey.

<b>                               WAYNE
</b>                    My problem Mickey, is that you don't
                    exactly inspire empathy. I'm all alone
                    on this. I need your help. I want
                    what the prison board is doing to be
                    the focus of our follow up episode.
                    Now I have interviews with chairman of
                    the prison board Dewight McClusky about
                    this issue. And I'm tellin' ya,
                    Mickey, he looks bad. The two
                    psychologists they used for their
                    psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk
                    to us, which always looks bad. I have
                    an interview with both the judge of
                    your trial, Bert Steinsma, and the
                    psychologist and author, Emil
                    Reinghold, both of which discount the
                    notion that you're insane. You put
                    that all together, and what the state
                    is doing becomes obvious. But the
                    network isn't satisfied. They feel the
                    show needs another element. It needs
                    you. In order to put the show on the
                    air, I need to get an interview with
                    you. You haven't talked to the press
                    since your trial. Now, a few days
                    before you get transferred to an
                    asylum, you grant an interview on
                    television with Wayne Gayle. We're
                    talkin' a media event here. Every son
                    of a bitch out the with a TV set's
                    gonna tune in to see that.
                    We'll make their motives so blatant,
                    we'll shame 'em into dropping the whole
                    thing. At least for a little while,
                    the publicity would keep them from just
                    giving you and Mallory lobotomies.
                    Well, whatta ya say?

<b>                               MICKEY

<b>                               WAYNE
</b>                    She won't even see me, Mickey. Now
                    you're not supposed to know anything
                    about what's going on with her, but I'm
                    gonna tell ya somethin'. Since you
                    two've been sentenced, Mallory hasn't
                    spoken one word.

<b>                               WAYNE

                    Pack', 'Town Without Pity', that Dusty
                    Springfield song 'I Only Want To Be
                    With You'. That's what I hear anyway.
                    Her behaviour was the main thing the
                    doctors' report used against you. So
                    even if she would see me, which she
                    won't, I couldn't put her on camera
                    anyway. If I ask her, 'Mallory, are
                    you insane?' And she starts singing
                    'Dead Skunk In The Middle Of The Road',
                    that blows our whole case.

     Mickey cracks a smile.

     The guards come over to take him away.

     decorum. Wayne's team is gathered in a booth that surrounds the
     remains of a greasy meal. In response to his last remark, they
     all pretend they are praying to him.

     The team consists of SCOTT, the cameraman, who wears wild
     t-shirts (presently a t-shirt with the movie 'She Devils On
     Wheels' splashed on the front); ROGER, the soundman, who wears
     wild Hawaiian shirts and Bermuda shorts; and UNRULY JULIE,
     Wayne's assistant, a young lady who wears Bermuda shorts, a
     baseball jersey, and a dark sports coat no matter how hot the
     weather is at any time. Roger's never seen without his
     recorder, Scott's never without his camera, and Unruly Julie
     always has her giant notebook. These dishevelled film types are
     all in their twenties and are a marked contrast to Wayne's
     stylish yuppie demeanour.

     Unruly Julie pops the cork on a champagne bottle. The guys hold
     out coffee mugs, while Julie fills. Julie, however drinks
     straight from the bottle.

                    crime spree that took place before pale
                    by comparison. The first point was the
                    decision of Mickey's to act as his own
                    council. Now this in itself is not
                    unheard of, for instance, Ted Bundy
                    acted as his own council as well. What
                    was unexpected was how well Mickey's
                    performance would be.

     Wayne interviews JUDGE BURT STEINSMA in his den at home.

<b>                               WAYNE (V.O.)
</b>                    We spoke with Burt Steinsma, who was
                    the presiding judge during the Knox
                    trial.

<b>                               JUDGE STEINSMA
</b>                    Mickey was surprisingly effective.
                    When I was told I was to be the judge
                    of this trial and then I was told
                    Mickey Knox would be handling his own
                    defence, I got a headache that lasted
                    five days. But at first I breathed a
                    sigh of relief. Mickey showed up very
                    prepared, and proved to be an excellent
                    amateur lawyer.

     woman in her forties.

<b>                               WAYNE (V.O.)
</b>                    However, this opinion isn't shared by
                    the state's prosecutor on this case,
                    Wanda Bisbing.

     Wayne's with Bisbing.

<b>                               WAYNE
</b>                    Judge Steinsma said that Mickey showed
                    up very prepared and proved to be an
                    excellent amateur attorney.

<b>                               BISBING
</b>                    Oh, that's rich. Well, considering
                    that Mickey Knox turn his court into
                    a mockery and personally made him look
                    like a fool, I'd say that's very
                    benevolent of Judge Steinsma. As far
                    as Mickey being an excellent amateur
                    lawyer, maybe I'm old fashioned, but
                    when I went to law school, we were
                    taught the object was to win the case,
                    which I did.

                    Mickey's talent as a defence attorney
                    became apparent.
                    Law students from all ends of the

                    did they let you two survive?

     The brothers pause, then turn to Wayne.

                    chainsaw to our legs before they were

<b>     CUT INTO INTERVIEW:
</b>
<b>                               NEIL POPE
</b>                    It is my belief that Mickey and Mallory
                    Knox are a cultural phenomena that
                    could only exist in our sexually
                    repressed society. A flower that could
                    only bloom amidst a grotesque fast food
                    culture. A what I tried to do with
                    'Thrill Killers' was trace the root of
                    the problem all the way down the vine
                    to the original bad seed. Yet amidst
                    the violence and murder and carnage,
                    you've got the structure of a Wagnerian
                    love story.

<b>     EXT. ALLEY - DAY

     In a back alley, the conclusion of 'Thrill Killers' plays out.
     The sound of SIRENS and CHOPPERS are nearing. Movie Mickey,
     shotgun in hand, runs down the alley stopping at a dumpster,
     where the wounded and bloody Movie Mallory sits propped up
     against a brick wall. On the bottom of the SCREEN, the
     subtitle appears: SCENE FROM 'THRILL KILLERS' (1990).

                    can't. I gotta stay here. But you can

                    leaving you. And that's that!

     Movie Mallory grabs his hand with both of hers. She's crying.

     The SIREN and CHOPPER sounds are getting closer.

                    husband, run for your life.

     The SIRENS and CHOPPERS draw closer.

                    a gun so I can go out shooting.

     Movie Mickey hands her his .44 Magnum from his belt.

<b>                               MOVIE MICKEY
</b>                    Sit tight. I'm gonna make it a little
                    tougher for 'em.

     Movie Mickey runs to the end of the alley, peers around the
     corner at the arriving COPS.

                    Time to get naked and boogie.

     Movie Mallory is out of movie Mickey's view. She cocks the .44,
     then places the barrel under her chin.

     Movie Mallory pulls the trigger. BANG!

     DOLLY down the alley to a CU on Mickey as he spins around.

     Movie Mallory literally blew her head clean off. Her headless
     body, gun in hand, remains upright in her sitting position.

     Movie Mickey runs toward her, screaming her name in SLOW MOTION.

</b>                    Why did you kill Mallory? Both of
                    them are still alive.

<b>                               NEIL POPE
</b>                    It was dramatic license, no doubt. But
                    I felt an operatic love story needed an
                    operatic ending. The two of them kill
                    for each other. They offer the death
                    of their victims to each other like
                    other lovers offer flowers or bon bons.
                    So what more natural, what more
                    organic, what more poetic than Mallory
                    offering her death to Mickey? It's
                    where it's been leading since day one.
                    We worked it in the movie by using a
                    what if they escaped situation. I
                    think it works beautifully. You'd be
                    surprised. People come up to me at the
                    end of the movie in tears.

<b>     EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

     Actor JESSIE ALEXANDER WARWICK sits on his motorcycle and talks

     is wrapped around his head, and as he talks he bogarts a smoke.

</b>                    One thing about Mickey for sure, he's
                    definitely a man who has his moments.
                    It was wild playin' him. It was one of
                    those get-it-out-of-your-system
                    performances.

<b>     INT. BUFFY ST. MCQUEEN'S HOME - DAY
</b>
     This interview is SHOT in Buffy's house a'la Barbara Walters.
     BUFFY sits on the couch in her living room with a cat in her
     lap. From time to time, she sips from a coffee cup. Her name
     appears at the bottom of the SCREEN.

<b>                               BUFFY
</b>                    I didn't play Mallory, the murderer. I
                    didn't play her as a butcher. I played
                    her as a woman in love, who also
                    happens to murder people. I didn't
                    want her to be at arm's length from the
                    audience or myself. If you play her as
                    this wild maniac, the audience never
                    has to deal with her. If you see a
                    decapitation in a movie, you just say
                    'Oh wow, a neat special effect.'
                    Because you can't relate to a
                    decapitation. It doesn't mean anything
                    to anybody because it's not personal.
                    Decapitations don't fall into most
                    people's realm of life experiences.
                    But if you show somebody in a movie
                    getting a paper cut, the whole audience
                    squirms. Because everybody can relate
                    to a paper cut.

     Wayne, sitting in a chair in front of a desk, interviews DR.
     REINGHOLD, who sits behind the desk.

<b>                               WAYNE (V.O.)
</b>                    To get a psychiatric view on the
                    strange attraction Mickey and Mallory
                    seems to have, we talked with Doctor
                    Emil Reinghold, noted psychologist and
                    author.

     Wayne begins his interview.

<b>                               WAYNE
</b>                    Can you shed some light, Doctor
                    Reinghold, on why the public has taken
                    a pair of sociopaths so close to their
                    bosom?

<b>                               DR. REINGHOLD
</b>                    Well, for one, the media has done a
                    tremendous job of turning the husband
                    and wife mass murderers into
                    celebrities. But it's the country's
                    youth who have turned the couple into
                    the ultimate anti-heroes. Basically,
                    the very thing that makes them most
                    lethal is the exact same thing that
                    captures the public's hearts and
                    minds -- Mickey and Mallory's operatic
                    devotion to each other. In a world
                    where people can't seem to make the
                    simplest relationships work and the
                    slightest emotional commitment is
                    considered devastating, Mick and
                    Mallory have a do-or-die romance of a
                    Shakespearean magnitude. To the
                    country's youth, 75 percent of which
                    are coming from broken homes, that's
                    appealing. They have an 'us against
                    the world' posture which always appeals
                    to youth. And they've taken that
                    posture seventeen steps beyond.
                    It's not 'us against the world,' it's
                    'we're gonna kill the world.' They're
                    exciting. I read their file and I find
                    myself turning the page like it was a
                    paperback. Why do disillusioned youths
                    get into Mickey and Mallory? Why do
                    disillusioned housewives read romance
                    novels? Why are you filming this
                    special? Because you know as well as I
                    do, you say 'tonight at nine Charles
                    Manson speaks,' everybody's going to
                    tune in to hear what he says. Mickey
                    and Mallory have shocked a country numb
                    with violence. They've created a world
                    where only two exist and anybody who
                    inadvertently enters that world is
                    murdered.

     All kinds of PEOPLE are gathered around. It's a real media

     Grace's sedan pulls up to the courthouse. The many spectators
     and reporters surround the car.

     Grace, HER FATHER, and BISBING emerge from the sedan, and start
     walking up the courthouse steps.

     Microphones and cameras are thrust at her as REPORTERS ask
     questions.

     Grace is afraid to face the crowd. Her head darts in the
     direction of each question, but she doesn't answer.

     She remains silent and scared.

</b>                    The style of fighting that Tim studied
                    didn't believe in belts.

<b>                               MICKEY

                    developed by Bruce Lee. Did you know

<b>                               GRACE

                    greatest martial artist of all times,

                    courtroom, the judge, honorable Burt
                    Steinsma, passed down a sentence that
                    was to make legal history.

<b>     INT. JUDGE'S DEN - DAY
</b>
     Interview with Judge Steinsma in his den at home.

     M.O.S. SHOT of Wayne and Judge talking.

<b>                               WAYNE (V.O.)
</b>                    We spoke with retired Judge Steinsma at
                    his home in Baltimore, Maryland.

     The interview:

<b>                               WAYNE
</b>                    Was there any vengeance on your part
                    with your unique sentence?

<b>                               JUDGE STEINSMA
</b>                    Yes, unquestionably. After they did
                    what they did in my court, and judge
                    worth his robe will tell you the same
                    thing. It couldn't help but affect my
                    decision. That's why they have judges.
                    We're supposed to be fair to a fault,
                    but when it's showtime, we have to make
                    a decision. That's why we don't just
                    input all the facts into a computer for
                    the appropriate punishment. I couldn't
                    give them the death penalty. See,
                    California hops back and forth on that
                    issue. Mickey and Mallory went to
                    court when it was out of favor, which
                    is actually good because it leaves more
                    room for imagination. Anybody can give
                    somebody the chair. When you have
                    someone who deserves to die and you
                    can't kill them, you have to be
                    creative. And if the bastards had let
                    it stand, it would of been the perfect
                    sentence. It hit 'em right where they
                    lived. Far more punishing than the
                    death sentence.

<b>                               WAYNE
</b>                    Would you please describe for our
                    viewers what your sentence was?

<b>                               JUDGE STEINSMA
</b>                    Well, in a rogue's gallery of killers,
                    Mickey and Mallory are very unique.
                    I've seen a lot of killers in my day
                    and they're a very cold lot. They have
                    no more feelings about taking a
                    person's life than squashing a tiny
                    bug. It's all the same to them. Well,
                    Mickey and Mallory were that 'kill 'em
                    to watch their expression change'
                    attitude personified. Except with each
                    other. And, since they lived only for
                    each other, I wanted to attack that, at
                    its very root. So, in a nutshell, my
                    sentence was double life for each
                    without any possibility for parole.
                    That would be fairly standard in their
                    case. The twist I added was that the
                    husband and wife would have no contact
                    or correspondence with each other for
                    the rest of their lives. And they
                    would never receive any word or
                    information about the other.
                    So, basically once the cell door slams
                    shut, Mickey and Mallory will
                    completely disappear from each other's
                    life. They'll never know when the
                    other dies. But alas, the best laid
                    plans of mice and men...

</b>                    The sentence was never to reach that
                    point. Because after only a year,
                    Mickey and Mallory created so much
                    mayhem that it was decided...

</b>                    We talked with Dewight McClusky,
                    chairman of the California State Prison
                    Board, about this curious turn of
                    events in the Mickey and Mallory case.

</b>
     Wayne's interviewing McClusky.

<b>                               WAYNE
</b>                    Why are Mickey and Mallory being moved
                    to an asylum? And who made the
                    decision?

<b>                               MCCLUSKY
</b>                    The prison board made the decision. A
                    board of which I belong. We're the
                    who. The why is simple. Mickey and
                    Mallory are mentally ill and need to be
                    under a doctor's care, where hopefully
                    they'll receive the help they need.

<b>                               WAYNE
</b>                    Mickey and Mallory were deemed
                    competent in a mental examination
                    before their trial. I'm confused.
                    What's changed?

<b>                               MCCLUSKY
</b>                    Well, since that time, they've killed
                    one person during their trail. And
                    since their incarceration, they've
                    killed one psychologist along with
                    several guards and inmates.

<b>                               WAYNE
</b>                    When they were found competent before,
                    they had already killed fifty people.
                    Other than the fact they're a
                    disciplinary problem, which frankly
                    shouldn't surprise anyone, I still
                    don't see where this situation is any
                    different then it was before. So, I
                    ask you again, Mr. McClusky, what's
                    changed?

<b>                               MCCLUSKY
</b>                    What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our
                    minds. We felt they were competent a
                    year ago. A year has passed, sir, a
                    year where they were under close
                    observation, day in and day out, and
                    their behaviour has led us to believe we
                    were wrong.

<b>                               WAYNE
</b>                    Who is we?

<b>                               MCCLUSKY
</b>                    The prison board and the doctors who
                    examined them.

<b>                               WAYNE
</b>                    Were any of the doctors who made the
                    first evaluation on the Knoxs mental
                    state asked to re-examine them?

<b>                               MCCLUSKY
</b>                    Using the same doctors is not common
                    practice.

<b>                               WAYNE
</b>                    I take it by your answer it was a whole
                    new team?

<b>                               MCCLUSKY
</b>                    Now that you bring it up, yes. They
                    were different men. I hadn't really
                    thought that much about it. Since many
                    psychiatric opinions are, by a rule,
                    sought out for this kind of situation.
                    What do you think normally happens?
                    The Knoxs are assigned a family
                    psychologist that takes care of them
                    throughout the rest of their lives?
                    The state doesn't work like that.

<b>     INT. DR. REINGHOLD'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
     Back with Dr. Reinghold. He's laughing.

<b>                               DR. REINGHOLD
</b>                    It's a funny situation actually. If
                    anyone besides Mickey and Mallory give
                    a damn, what the prison board is doing
                    would be considered an outrage. The
                    prison board is basically saying, 'We
                    can't handle these guys.' They've
                    moved 'em around twice since their
                    sentence started.
                    They were a handful everywhere they
                    went. Now the prisons they're at now
                    want them outta there. But no other
                    prison's gonna be stupid enough to take
                    'em. So the prison board is left
                    scratching their heads wondering what
                    they're gonna do. Well, what they
                    decided to do was to set up a kangaroo
                    medical court that found them crazy.
                    Then they get them transferred to
                    Nystrom Medical Asylum or Lobotomy Bay
                    as it's referred to in the psychiatric
                    circle. Put 'em on a strict dope and
                    electro shock diet, and Mickey and
                    Mallory cease to be a problem to
                    anybody except the orderlies who clean
                    out the bedpans, which if you want to
                    see them get theirs, that's all well
                    and good. But there's something being
                    said here. Forget the immorality for a
                    second. Forget the corruption and the
                    skulduggery involved. What the board
                    is saying is 'we give up.' Mickey and
                    Mallory ran amuck in polite society.
                    They were put in an alternative society
                    and they ran amuck there, too. All the
                    powers that be, can't deal with these
                    two kids. And whatever can't be
                    assimilated has to be terminated.

<b>                               WAYNE
</b>                    So, in your opinion Mickey and Mallory
                    are not insane?

<b>                               DR. REINGHOLD
</b>                    Insane, no. Psychotic, yes. A menace
                    to living creatures, yes. But to
                    suggest that they're insane gives the
                    impression that they don't know right
                    from wrong. Mickey and Mallory know
                    the difference between right and wrong.
                    They just don't give a damn.

<b>     INT. NEWS VAN - MOVING - DAY
</b>
     Through Scott's CAMERA, we're filming this in BLACK AND WHITE -
     16mm.

     NOTE: Everytime we're viewing through Scott's CAMERA, we are
     filming handheld in 16mm BLACK AND WHITE. Until otherwise
     specified, the SHOTS stay in Scott's CAMERA.

     Scott's filming the back of the newsvan. Roger's sitting in the
     back eating donuts as is Wayne. Unruly Julie's up front
     driving.

<b>                               WAYNE
</b>                         (with mouthful of donut)
                    How's it working, Scotty?

<b>                               SCOTT (O.S.)
</b>                    Perfecto!

     Roger's picking through a box of donuts. Scott PANS over to
     him, then slowly ZOOMS in on him.

<b>                               ROGER
</b>                    Where the fuck's the chocolate cream
                    filled? Did anyone get my chocolate
                    cream filled? If you did, it's mine.

     CU of Roger, looking into CAMERA.

<b>                               ROGER
</b>                    I pointed at a chocolate cream filled.
                    You saw me do it, didn't you?

     Wayne starts talking. We PAN from Roger to a CU of Wayne.

<b>                               WAYNE
</b>                    You were there. Did you see him put it
                    in a box?

     We PAN back to a CU of Roger.

<b>                               ROGER
</b>                    At the time, I was too busy explaining
                    to Scott the finer points of film.

     We ZOOM back to a WIDE SHOT.

<b>                               SCOTT (O.S.)
</b>                    Yeah, right. You know what he said?
                    He said, Indiana Jones And The Temple
                    Of Doom is Spielberg's best film.

     Wayne starts laughing. We hear Scott laugh too.

<b>                               WAYNE
</b>                         (to Roger)
                    You can't be serious?

<b>                               ROGER
</b>                         (preoccupied)
                    I'm as serious about that as I am about
                    going back to the donut store, and
                    dipping that stupid Mexican's head into
                    the batter for forgetting my chocolate
                    cream filled. Gimme that other box.

<b>                               WAYNE
</b>                    Huh uh. This dozen is for Mickey.

<b>                               ROGER
</b>                    That dumbass probably put my chocolate
                    cream filled in there by mistake.

<b>                               WAYNE
</b>                    Roger, no.

<b>                               ROGER
</b>                    What's the big deal? Take out my
                    chocolate cream filled, put one of
                    these roasted coconut---

<b>                               WAYNE
</b>                    Roger, do you understand what the word
                    'no' means? It's important we
                    establish a rapport. Something as
                    simple as a dozen donuts can mean the
                    world to somebody who hasn't had a
                    donut in a year.

<b>                               ROGER
</b>                    So you're giving a man who butchers
                    whole families, little babies included,
                    my chocolate cream filled?

     Unruly Julie HONKS the horn. Wayne gets up and looks out the
     windshield.

<b>                               WAYNE
</b>                    Okay, guys, we're here. L.A. County
                    Jail. Julie, just park in the front.

<b>                               ROGER
</b>                    Wayne---

<b>                               WAYNE
</b>                    Roger, I'm starting to get pissed.
                    Just drop this fuckin' donut shit, and
                    gather your gear.

     The van stops. Wayne slides open the panel door, and steps out.

<b>     EXT. LOS ANGELES COUNTY JAIL - DAY
</b>
     BACK TO: COLOR 35mm.

     Wayne hops out of the van and is approached by Superintendent
     Phil Wurlitzer who's followed by two DEPUTY SHERIFFS.

<b>                               WAYNE
</b>                         (aside to Scott)
                    Here's the welcome wagon.

     Wurlitzer reaches them and shakes Wayne's hand.

<b>                               WURLITZER
</b>                    Hello, Mr. Gayle. I'm Phil Wurlitzer.
                    We talked on the phone. It's a
                    pleasure to meet you.

<b>                               WAYNE
</b>                    Same here. Let me introduce my crew.
                    Scott...Roger...and Unruly Julie
                    ...this is...I'm sorry. What's
                    your title again?

<b>                               WURLITZER
</b>                    I'm the superintendent here at L.A.
                    County Jail. Me and my deputies are
                    who you'll be working with while you're
                    here.

<b>                               WAYNE
</b>                    That sounds great. Look, I don't want
                    any of this to intimidate you. This is
                    not going to be a big deal. This is
                    going to be very easy.
                         (to his crew)
                    I need to talk with Mr. Wurlitzer. You
                    guys get your equipment ready, power up
                    the van and confirm a transmission code
                    for the remote. Julie come with me.

     Julie tosses the keys to Roger and shadows Wayne as he speaks
     confidentially to Wurlitzer.

<b>                               WAYNE
</b>                    The main thing I need is a big room,
                    shut off from the population, so we can
                    get some privacy...with a few
                    electrical outlets.

<b>     INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY
</b>
     Wayne and his crew have set up in the food supply room off from
     the cafeteria. Being big, roomy, and unpopulated, it's perfect
     for an interview. There's eight L.A. County DEPUTY SHERIFFS
     around the room along with Wurlitzer. Roger's setting up his
     sound equipment while Unruly Julie is checking her notebook.

     Wurlitzer and a few Deputies talk among themselves. CAMERA
     moves from person to person without cutting.

<b>                               WURLITZER
</b>                         (to two Deputies)
                    This is just for an interview, I was
                    on the set of 'Dukes of Hazzard' once.
                    It was a much bigger deal than this.
                    They had a crew of maybe seventy-five
                    people.

     CAMERA moves to Wayne and Scott.

<b>                               WAYNE
</b>                    We're gonna be talking over here. But
                    I want enough freedom so if I wanna get
                    up and move around, we can.

     Wayne grabs Scott and walks him to the left.

<b>                               WAYNE
</b>                    Take him and walk him over this way.
                         (pretending Scott's
                         Mickey)
                    So, Mickey, killing Mallory's parents,
                    what the hell was that all about?
                         (pauses--to Scott)
                    Then maybe take him to the window.

     He walks Scott to the window.

<b>                               WAYNE
</b>                         (pretending Scott's
                         Mickey)
                    So, Mickey, if you were let outta jail
                    today, what's the first thing you'd do?
                         (pause--to Scott)
                    Little shit like that. I don't wanna
                    have to feel I gotta stay in the
                    chairs. We're after a cinema verite,
                    anything can happen, truth twenty-four
                    times a second kindda feel.

     End of single SHOT.

     Wurlitzer's talking with Deputies.

<b>                               WURLITZER
</b>                    And when it's lunch time, they don't
                    just go to McDonalds. They got cooks
                    there servin' great food. Swedish
                    meatballs...

     Wayne walks over to Wurlitzer and Deputies.

<b>                               WURLITZER
</b>                    How's everything coming, Mr. Gayle?

<b>                               WAYNE
</b>                    Everything's coming along just fine.
                    Phil, I wanted to know if I could have
                    a small word with you.

<b>                               WURLITZER
</b>                    By all means.

     Wayne puts his hand on Wurlitzer's shoulder. They walk around
     the room.

<b>                               WAYNE
</b>                    You met the kids I have working for me?
                    Great bunch, aren't they?

<b>                               WURLITZER
</b>                    Oh yes, indeed. Top flight.

<b>                               WAYNE
</b>                    Scott, genius cameraman, Roger,
                    magician with sound. Unruly Julie, I
                    could sooner do without my arm than
                    Unruly Julie.

<b>                               WURLITZER
</b>                    Is that her real name?

<b>                               WAYNE
</b>                    Just a little nickname. Yep, they're
                    my kids and they're all I need. After
                    working together these past coupla
                    years, we're like well-oiled machinery.
                    No, more like a Formula race car. No,
                    scratch that one, too. What we're
                    really like is a Swiss watch. Small,
                    intricate, compact...it shouldn't
                    work as well as it does, but it does.
                    Because of the craftsmanship, the
                    expertise, and the artist's loving
                    hand.

     Wayne gives Wurlitzer a moment to digest this.

<b>                               WURLITZER
</b>                    I see.

<b>                               WAYNE
</b>                    Now, Phil, I don't know if you've ever
                    been on a set before---

<b>                               WURLITZER

<b>                               WAYNE

<b>                               WURLITZER
</b>                    I was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard' set
                    about eight years ago.

<b>                               WAYNE
</b>                         (still acting surprised)
                    Well...small world. Well, then, you
                    know firsthand how Hollywood does
                    things. Lights all over the place,
                    generators, a hundred and fifty crew
                    members---

<b>                               WURLITZER
</b>                    Oh, that 'Dukes of Hazzard' show, there
                    was probably ninety-five people there,
                    maybe more.

<b>                               WAYNE

                    business, isn't it?

<b>                               WURLITZER
</b>                    It sure is.

<b>                               WAYNE

                    A asshole perched up there.
                         (points straight up)
                    Assholes everywhere. Hey, maybe if we
                    were doin' that kiss, kiss, bang, bang
                    stuff we'd need all those assholes,
                    too. What we're about is intimacy.
                    We're about two people having a
                    conversation. Say I was interviewing
                    you. All I want you to worry about is
                    what I ask you. I want a trust to
                    develop. If you're thinking about all
                    this...
                         (indicates the hustle and
                         bustle of a set)
                    ...you're not going to relax, a trust
                    won't develop, we'll be talking a each
                    other instead of to each other, there
                    will be no chance for intimacy.

     Wayne gives Wurlitzer a chance to take this in.

                    Mickey Knox to relax...Mickey Knox to
                    share what he's never shared before...
                    Mickey Knox to open doors which 'till
                    today have been closed. Well, how can
                    we expect him to do that when we got
                    Los Angeles County Sheriffs up
                    the walls.

     Suddenly, things get short between the two men.

                    Well, just what the hell do you expect

                    customers in my day. Mickey Knox
                    doesn't scare me. Two...I'm a

                    that risk. Three...it ain't gonna
                    happen. Believe me when I tell you, it
                    is in Mickey Knox's own best interest
                    to play this game according to Hoyle.

     Mallory springs out of bed, and into a fighting stance.

     The SOUND of Mallory's bare feet slapping the concrete floor,
     along with the clip-clop-clip-clop of the deputies' shoes,
     reverberates throughout the scene.

     Mallory walks slightly ahead of the two shotgun wielding
     deputies, when Scagnetti slips in beside her. He lights up a
     cigarette with his Zippo, and talks a long drag.

     CAMERA holds on Mickey standing still as the two deputies remove
     the chains.

<b>     INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY
</b>
     CAMERA is inside a holding cell fixed on the cell door. The
     cell door is unlocked, then opened. The two deputies bring
     Mallory inside. Scagnetti wanders in, trailing behind.

     Bingham pumps his shotgun slide and places the barrel next to
     Mallory's head. Washington unlocks the cuffs around Mallory's
     wrists.

     Mallory's silent.

     Scagnetti leans up against the wall, smoking his cigarette.

<b>                               BINGHAM

     Bingham and Washington move to the door.

     Bingham and Washington move outside.

     Scagnetti takes out his gun and tosses it to Washington. Before
     they can protest, Scagnetti closes the door.

     Mallory stands in the middle of the cell, motionless, her back
     to him.

     Scagnetti walks up behind her.

     Mallory doesn't move.

<b>                               SCAGNETTI

</b>                    C'mon, I already lit one for you. I
                    know you smoke.

     Mallory doesn't respond. Scagnetti takes the cigarette from his
     mouth and puts it between Mallory's lips. Hold on C.U. of
     Mallory.

<b>                               SCAGNETTI

                    answer was always the same...'I love
                    Mickey.' It also says that when they
                    gave you a polygraph, 'I love Mickey'
                    was the only thing you said that
                    registered as the truth.

     Mallory spits the lit cigarette unto Scagnetti's face.
     Scagnetti spins her around and slaps her.

     Mallory looks at him for a moment, then gives his a massive HEAD
     BUTT. As we hear the CRACKING of his nose, Scagnetti lets out a
     horrible scream.

     Bingham and Washington fumble with the keys to open the cell
     door.

<b>     INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY
</b>
     Bingham and Washington burst through the door to find Scagnetti
     face down on the ground.

     Mallory's standing, her foot pressed against the middle of
     Scagnetti's back, pulling his arms behind him trying to break
     his back. His body is bending like a branch, and he's
     screaming.

     The two deputies proceed to BEAT the shit out of her with their
     shotguns.

     Scagnetti rolls around in the B.G., holding his bloody nose,
     screaming.

<b>                               SCAGNETTI

     He grabs Scagnetti's nose, then SNAPS it back into place.
     Scagnetti lets out another horrible scream, and hops up and down
     from the pain.

     When the rush of pain passes, Scagnetti brings his hands down
     from his face, looking over at Mallory.

     Bingham has Mallory in the corner of the cell with the shotgun
     barrel placed in her mouth.

     CU on Scagnetti. He's a hand grenade with the pin pulled.

<b>                               SCAGNETTI
</b>                    Hold her, boys.

     Scagnetti walks to the corner where Mallory is. The shotgun
     barrel's out of her mouth. Bingham and Washington stand on
     either side of her, holding her in place.

     Scagnetti grabs a can of mace from Washington's belt, and brings
     it up to Mallory's face.

     Mallory and Scagnetti trade looks.

     Scagnetti gives her an intense blast of mace right in the face,
     eyes, and all over her body.

     Mallory crumples to the floor, screaming in agony.

     TWO SHOT of Bingham and Washington looking down at Mallory on
     the ground. We can hear Scagnetti still spraying her. They
     can't look at this anymore.

     Mallory wiggles on the floor as Scagnetti continues spraying her
     all over her body.

     CU of Scagnetti's bloody face smiling. We hear the SOUND of the
     can of mace running empty. It spurts to a stop.

     Scagnetti rises up to the two deputies. He hands the empty can
     back to Washington.

<b>                               SCAGNETTI
</b>                    I want this filled before we leave.

     The three men walk out of the holding cell, closing and locking
     the door behind them. We can still hear Mallory's screams of
     excruciating pain.

                    Grains of the golden sand--
                    How few! yet how they creep
                    Through my fingers to the deep,

                    Is all that we see or seem

                    I used to be you...then I evolved.
                    From where you're standing, you're a
                    man. From where I'm standing, you're a
                    ape. I'm here...I'm right here...
                    and you...you're somewhere else, man.

     Scagnetti walks down the hallway leading to the supply room.
     His face is a patchwork of medical tape, to set his broken nose.
     Bloody cotton protrudes from each nostril.

<b>     INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY
</b>
     Scagnetti walks into the supply room. Mickey is explaining to
     Wayne 'Why he's killed all those people.' Scagnetti can't
     believe what he's seeing. The entire room is in rapture.

<b>                               MICKEY
</b>                    ...one night I was asleep, and a noise
                    wakes me up. I thought, 'Oh shit,
                    somebody's broken in.' I didn't own a
                    gun, so I go into the living room with
                    a fucking umbrella. Okay, it turned
                    out to be nothing. God made the noise.

     CAMERA leaves them and travels the room, studying the faces of
     the deputies, Unruly Julie, Roger, and Wayne as they listen to
     Mickey's story.

<b>                               MICKEY
</b>                    But I came to the direction I need a
                    gun. Do, the next day I started off
                    early for work, and I'm gonna stop by a
                    gun shop and pick up a little home
                    protection. I walked into the place
                    and had never seen so many guns in all
                    my life. So, I'm lookin' around, the
                    this really nice sales guy comes up to
                    me. His name was Warren. I'll never
                    forget his name. He was really nice.
                    Anyway, Warren showed me all these
                    different models of guns. Magnums,
                    automatics, pistols, Walters. And I
                    ask to see a shotgun. He brings me a
                    Mossberg pump action shotgun. As soon
                    as I held that baby in my hands, I knew
                    what I was gonna do. It felt so good.
                    It felt like it was a part of me. They
                    had a mirror in the store. I looked at
                    myself holding it, and looked so
                    fuckin' good, I immediately bought it.
                    Bought a bunch of boxes of ammo.
                    Turned my car around, drove to
                    Mallory's house, we took care of
                    Mallory's parents, packed up the car,
                    and we were off.

                    cops, my mom, everybody. But you see,
                    they all missed the point of the story.
                    I wasn't crazy. But when I was holding
                    the shotgun, it all became clear. I
                    realized for the first time my one true
                    calling in life. I'm a natural born
                    killer.

     Unruly Julie writes down Wayne's order in her notebook, then
     goes from person to person collecting their orders.

     Scagnetti and Wurlitzer talk to each other.

     CAMERA PANS away from Wurlitzer to the extremely curious
     eavesdroppers.

     CAMERA glides by all of them: Scagnetti, Wayne, Scott, Roger,
     Unruly Julie, and finally ends up on Mickey.

     CAMERA holds on Mickey as he contemplates Wurlitzer's
     conversation.

     notebook.

                    patty burgers. Now they don't have
                    that on the menu, but if you order a
                    four by four, they'll know what you're
                    talking about. A large Coke and two
                    orders of fries.

     When she finishes writing down Mickey's order, Julie walks off
     silently.

     CAMERA follows Julie out the door and into...

     CAMERA DOLLIES with Julie as she walks down the corridor.

     As DEPUTIES with shotguns and riot gear speed down the hall, the

     MOB of other SHADOWS carrying NIGHTSTICKS and BARS.

     The Mob catches the Prison Guard and beat him mercilessly before
     moving on.

                    her. She says okay. They go to the
                    drive-in, they come back. The mother
                    gets Little Johnny and says, 'Okay,
                    what happened? Where did ya go?'

     Mickey, as Little Johnny, draws a square in the air, and acts
     like he's driving.

                    did they do?'

     Mickey, as Little Johnny, vigorously acts as if he's jacking
     off.

     Everyone in the room breaks up. Wayne, the boys, the deputies,
     even Scagnetti cracks a smile.

     As Mickey was telling the joke, he stopped in front of Deputy #4
     during the punchline.

     While everybody's laughing, Mickey SLAMS his elbow in Deputy
     #4's face. Mickey grabs hold of the shotgun, rips it from
     Deputy #4's grasp, then BASHES him in the face three times with
     the butt.

     Deputy #4 drops, ugly and unconscious.

     Scott's CAMERA goes wild.

     The other deputies react.

     Mickey pumps the shotgun slide and shoots, hitting Deputy #5 in
     the chest, BLOWING him off his feet. He lands on his back with
     a THUD.

     Deputy #3 raises his shotgun. Mickey drops to a crouching
     position and FIRES, BLASTING Deputy #3 in the groin.

     Deputy #3 crumples into the wall, FIRING his gun -- SLOW MOTION.

     The stray bullet THUNKS Scott right in the chest, BLOWING him
     out of FRAME.

     Deputy #3 drops to the floor, FIRING his shotgun straight up --

                    he is armed and apparently there has
                    been some loss of life. We will try to
                    re-establish contact with Wayne Gayle
                    and bring you more on this late
                    breaking story. Please stay tuned.

     WIDE SHOT of Mickey, holding his shotgun. He walks over and
     grabs the shotgun from dead Deputy #5. Deputy #5 won't let go
     of the gun from his dead man's grip. Mickey finally yanks it
     loose. He extracts all the shells from the gun, picks them off
     the floor, and puts them in his pocket.

     Mickey picks up Scagnetti's gun, inserts the loose bullets and
     slips it into his pants.

<b>                               MICKEY
</b>                    Okay, Jack, this is what we're doing.
                    Stand behind me, put your back against
                    mine and extend your arms behind you.

     Scagnetti rises, insecurely. He presses his back against
     Mickey's.

<b>                               MICKEY
</b>                    Now if I feel your back move away from
                    mine, you're gonna be ripped apart.
                    Got it?

     Scagnetti's back to back with Mickey. His arms flank Mickey.

<b>                               SCAGNETTI
</b>                    Yeah.

<b>                               MICKEY
</b>                    Okay, Wayne, step forward.

     Wayne enters FRAME. Mickey extends the shotgun.

<b>                               MICKEY
</b>                    Keep comin'. Put your solar plexus
                    against the barrel.

     Wayne does.

<b>                               MICKEY
</b>                    Grab his arms.

     Wayne does and Mickey quickly binds their arms together with
     gaffer's tape, forming a two man ring around him.

<b>                               MICKEY
</b>                    Either one of you two move, it's gonna
                    be shotgun city. You understand?

<b>                               WAYNE & SCAGNETTI
</b>                    Yes.

     Mickey tucks the tape roll into his shirt.

<b>                               MICKEY
</b>                    You ready, Donut?

<b>                               MICKEY
</b>                    Wagons, hooaaa!

     The hostage train starts moving. Wayne's walking backwards with
     the shotgun barrel pressed against his midsection. Scagnetti's
     walking back to back with Mickey and his own pistol pressed to
     his neck.

     Roger follows with the camera.

     Mallory's sitting Indian style, singing Girl Scout songs to
     herself, and doing the hand motions.

     The cell door opens and the hostage train of Wayne, Mickey,
     Scagnetti, Roger and the camera, and two DEPUTIES they picked up
     along the way enters the room. The hostages are all wrapped
     with tape.

     CU on Mallory. She can't believe her eyes.

                    Honey, I'm home.

     Mallory runs into Mickey's arms, passionately kissing. This
     kiss has been a year coming. Now they're doing something
     everybody told them they would never do again.

     For this moment they are the only two people on earth. We're
     enraptured, too. CAMERA does a 360 around the loving couple.

     Wurlitzer drops into a chair, exhausted. He rubs his face with
     his hands.

                    in her holding cell with Wayne Gayle,
                    another TV guy, that cop fella, and two
                    other deputies as hostages. And

                    to do?

     Wurlitzer holds a frozen look, as if a fuse has blown and his
     mind has shut down. If he were to open his mouth now nothing
     would come out. He just sits.

     The hostages have been cut free from each other and sit against
     the wall. Roger cradles the Betacam in his lap, rocking slowly
     as if in a trance, while Scagnetti feebly splints his broken
     fingers with the tape that hangs from his wrists. Wayne is
     standing, alert and ready for action.

     As for the two deputies, HOSTAGE DEPUTY #1 sits in anger,
     tight-lipped and stoic. The other, DEPUTY DUNCAN HOMOLKA is
     panicked and jumpy, one may never see a more nervous man.

     Mickey and Mallory stand over them with their weapons drawn.

                    Donut said something about a news van.

     Wayne points to Roger. Roger digs through his pocket and tosses
     the keys to Mickey.

<b>                               WAYNE

     Duncan begins to cry.

     Roger snaps up and hoists the camera to his shoulder.

<b>     VIDEO FOOTAGE:

     Shot through Roger's CAMERA: IMAGE FOCUSES on Mallory as she
     points to Scagnetti sitting on the floor.

<b>                               MALLORY
</b>                    You! Stand up!

     Scagnetti gulps, then rises knowing that he has fucked with the
     wrong woman.

     Mallory walks up to him with pistol in hand.

<b>                               MALLORY
</b>                    You probably thought it was pretty
                    funny, didn't ya?

     She raises Scagnetti's pistol, aiming it at its former owner.
     Scagnetti flinches and squirms.

<b>                               MALLORY

                    Good.

     Mallory fires three shots into Scagnetti's chest.

     Roger's CAMERA jumps, then follows the body to the floor. Roger
     HOLDS on Scagnetti slumped on the floor.

<b>                               DUNCAN (O.S.)

     OFF SCREEN the door is kicked open.

     Roger's CAMERA whips around to witness Mickey and Mallory
     jumping into the corridor, BLASTING with their guns while using
     the hostages for shields. Roger's CAMERA moves out of the cell
     and...

<b>     INT. JAIL CORRIDOR (OUTSIDE THE HOLDING CELL) - DAY

     There are even more DEPUTY SHERIFFS in the corridor.

     CROSS FIRE whistles by as Roger dodges to catch up with the
     caravan.

     The footage is very similar to Vietnam footage. It's shaky,
     real, harsh, and it captures the pandemonium of battle.

     The soundtrack is a mixture of yelling, crying, laughing,
     and gunfire.

     HOSTAGE DEPUTY #1 is SHOT, and discarded by Mickey.

     The wild caravan runs down the hallway, FIRING behind them.

     Mickey's HIT, but keeps on running and FIRING. Mallory sees
     this and screams.

                    Vietnam!

     More DEPUTIES appear at the end of the hallway.

     Mickey and Mallory get back to back with each other, using
     DUNCAN as a shield in front of them and Wayne behind them.
     Mickey FIRES from the front, Mallory FIRES from the rear.

<b>                               DUNCAN

     CAMERA WHIP PANS to catch a Deputy hopping around the corner.
     The SCREEN FLASHES WHITE with a BLAST.

     Roger's HIT, and the CAMERA goes haywire, reeling out of
     control, the THUNKING to the ground. Roger screams O.S.

     CAMERA lies on the floor, video still transmitting. Roger rolls
     into FRAME screaming.

     BACK TO: COLOR 35mm.

     As Mickey FIRES cover for her, Mallory swipes the camera from
     Roger's side.

     The Knox's start running again, still holding Wayne and last
     hostage.

     Deputies are lying on the ground, wounded and screaming, or dead
     and silent.

<b>     INT. STAIRWELL - DAY

     The caravan bursts into the stairwell. Mickey turns to Duncan
     the remaining hostage deputy.

</b>                         (to Duncan)
                    Where does this lead?

     Duncan is hyper-ventilating. Mickey pushes him against to
     wall.

<b>                               MICKEY

<b>                               MICKEY
</b>                    Let's go.

     Mickey grabs Duncan and the caravan starts running down the
     stairs. They go down a few flights.

     As they run down one last flight, they find Wurlitzer and a team
     of DEPUTIES waiting for them on the ground floor. The deputies
     raise their guns.

     Mallory grabs hold of Wayne, and gets behind him with one hand
     pressing the barrel of her gun against his temple and her other
     are wrapped around his neck, holding him close to her.

<b>                               MALLORY

                    blast him!

     None of the deputies lower their guns, but they appear less
     likely to start shooting.

     Wayne screams.

<b>                               MALLORY
</b>                    I said shut up...

     Mallory quickly lowers her gun from Wayne's head and SHOOTS him
     in the thigh. She whips the gun back up to his head.

     Wayne's screaming in pain.

     The deputies jump back.

<b>                               MALLORY
</b>                    ...and I mean shut up!

     There's a bit of a silent standoff.

     Tears are streaming down Duncan's face as the caravan slowly
     retreats back up the stairs to the next flight.

     The deputies hold their present position.

</b>
     The caravan goes up one flight, then stops. Mickey and Mallory
     let their two hostages sit down.

     Duncan is out and out hysterical, urine stains the front of his
     uniform.

     Mickey's pacing.

<b>                               MICKEY
</b>                    Think...think...think...

     Mallory leans up against the wall, holding her side with her
     hand. Blood trickles out between the fingers. We see now she's
     been shot.

     Over Duncan's impassioned clamour they can hear Wurlitzer yelling
     from below.

<b>                               WURLITZER (O.S.)
</b>                    Give up! There's no other way out!

     Mickey sits down, utterly exhausted. Mallory sits down next to.
     him. She winces in pain. He puts his arm around her.

<b>                               MALLORY
</b>                    Look, lover boy, we're not getting
                    outta here. So I say the hell with
                    going back to our cells. Let's do a
                    Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.
                    Run down these stairs shootin', go out
                    in a hail of bullets, but take as many
                    of those motherfuckers with us as
                    possible.

     Suddenly, Mickey's exhaustion lifts. He has a plan.

<b>                               MICKEY
</b>                    We'll do that when all else fails.

     Mickey stands.

<b>                               MALLORY
</b>                    Hasn't it?

</b>                    We still got a few tricks up our
                    sleeves.

     Mickey confronts the two hostages. He points at Duncan.

<b>                               MICKEY
</b>                    You married?

</b>                    Are you married? Do you have kids?

     Duncan nods pathetically.

</b>                    Good. People, we're goin' all the way

                    want to kill you two more than they
                    want to kill us.

<b>     INSERT:
</b>
     SHOTS of deputies with guns in their hands, just itching to kill
     Mickey and Mallory. We hear Mickey's voice over this SHOT.

<b>                               MICKEY (V.O.)
</b>                    Right now I find that highly unlikely.
                    So, let's help 'em out, shall we?

<b>     BACK TO PRISON STAIRWELL:
</b>
     Mickey is squatting in front of Wayne.

<b>                               MICKEY
</b>                    Now, say I tell those guys down there
                    if they shoot or make a move, I'm
                    killin' Wayne Gayle. And they shoot or
                    make a move anyway. Now say by some
                    freak accident, you didn't die, you
                    live though it. What would you do?

     Mickey pulls the roll of GAFFER'S TAPE from his shirt and starts
     tearing strips of tape and sticking them to the wall.

<b>                               WAYNE
</b>                    What would I do? Me and my network
                    would sue the entire Los Angeles County
                    Sheriffs Department for flagrantly
                    disregarding my safety. I'd go
                    straight to my buddy, the mayor, and
                    make sure everyone of those son of a
                    bitches down there ends up on the
                    unemployment line. In fact, I'd sue
                    every man down there personally. I
                    would make it my life's ambition to
                    bring the LA County Jail to its knees.
                    I would do expose after expose on the
                    brutality, and the conditions, and the
                    inhumanity that exists here.

     Mickey tosses the tape roll to Mallory and gestures to Duncan.
     Mallory winks at Mickey. Mickey smiles and begins wrapping tape
     around the barrel of his shotgun.

<b>                               MICKEY
</b>                    That's what I thought. You tell them
                    that. When we go down those stairs, I
                    want you to scream what you just told
                    me. 'My name is Wayne Gayle! I am the
                    star of American Maniacs watched every
                    week by'-- how many people?

<b>                               WAYNE
</b>                    On average forty million.

<b>                               MICKEY
</b>                    'Every week by forty million people. I
                    am a respected journalist.' Have you
                    won any awards?

<b>                               WAYNE

</b>                    'Respected journalist'-- On your
                    knees...

     Wayne kneels in front of Mickey. While Mickey speaks he props
     his shotgun under Wayne's chin and wraps the tape from the
     barrel around his neck.

<b>                               MICKEY
</b>                         (continues)
                    ...'Winner of the Golden Globe and the
                    Edward R. Murrow award among others.'
                    Tell 'em the name of your personal
                    lawyer, his firm, his address, and
                    phone number. Tell 'em about the mayor
                    and the unemployment lines. You
                    getting the idea?

<b>                               WAYNE
</b>                    Yes.

     Mickey stands with Wayne as he tapes his trigger hand to the
     stock of the shotgun.

<b>                               MICKEY
</b>                    Say it. Scream it. All the way out
                    the front door and into your van. And
                    if you stop screaming, I swear to God
                    I'll blow your head off.

<b>                               WAYNE
</b>                    Got it.

     Mickey grabs the camera, and lifts it to his shoulder before
     shouting to Duncan.

<b>                               MICKEY
</b>                    You! What's your name?

     Duncan can't answer, Mallory has gagged him with his tape. Mallory
     grabs Duncan by the collar and lifts him off the floor before
     reading his name badge.

<b>                               MALLORY
</b>                    Duncan...Homolka?

<b>     INT. PRISON STAIRWELL (GROUND FLOOR) - DAY
</b>
     Wurlitzer and the deputies are deciding their next move when
     they hear:

<b>                               MICKEY (O.S.)
</b>                    Start.

     Wayne and Duncan come into view with the Knoxs behind them.

     The deputies quickly raise their guns, but soon realize if they
     take out either Mickey of Mallory that Wayne or Duncan would
     die.

     Mallory's right hand is taped to the trigger and stock of the
     shotgun that's wrapped firmly to Duncan's neck. The pistol in
     her left hand is trained on Wurlitzer.

     Mickey's left hand masters the shotgun leash on Wayne, while he
     monitors the Deputies with the CAMERA on his right shoulder.

     NOTE: The following scene will intercut between VIDEO FOOTAGE
     and COLOR 35mm.

     Wayne starts belting out his speech as Mickey focus the CAMERA
     on Wurlitzer. Duncan simply cries and begs for his life to be
     spared.

<b>                               WAYNE

                    million people every week! I am a
                    respected journalist, winners of the
                    Golden Globe, the Edward R.

                    puts me in danger, my network will sue

                    officer personally who fires. The
                    network's law firm is Rowlands, Davis
                    and Sinclair...

     Mickey knew what he was doing. This has an effect on the
     deputies.

<b>                               MALLORY
</b>                         (yelling)
                    Make a path!

     The wall of deputies starts moving backward.

     The Knoxs and their hostages start moving forward with Wayne
     yelling all the way.

     The deputies keep their guns trained on the caravan, but they
     keep giving ground, until they reach the doors of the front
     lobby and they begin to part like the Red Sea.

     Wurlitzer stands his ground.

<b>                               WURLITZER
</b>                    How far do you think your gonna get?

<b>                               MICKEY
</b>                    Right out the front door.

<b>                               WURLITZER
</b>                    That'll never happen.

<b>                               MICKEY
</b>                    It is happening.

     The caravan marches forth. Wayne and Duncan keep shouting their
     speeches. Nobody dares to move on them, but the deputies keep
     their weapons ready.

     Wayne stops his speech to take a breath.

<b>                               MALLORY
</b>                    Don't stop!

     Wayne starts up again.

     The deputies are completely frustrated. Mickey and Wurlitzer
     are nose to nose.

<b>                               WURLITZER
</b>                         (to Mickey)
                    I will personally hunt you down, blow
                    the head off your fucking-whore-wife,
                    and plant your sick ass in the ground
                    all by myself.

<b>                               MICKEY
</b>                         (calmly)
                    Another day perhaps, but not today.

     Mickey leaves FRAME.

<b>     EXT. COUNTY JAIL - DAY
</b>
     The doors swing wide in SLOW MOTION as the caravan of Mickey,
     Mallory, Wayne and Duncan take their first step into the open
     air.

     A crescent of deputies frame the group in the B.G. while
     Wurlitzer stands, defeated, just behind Mickey.

     FREEZE FRAME on WIDE ANGLE.

     Image DISSOLVES to BLACK & WHITE before BURNING into WHITE
<b>     LEADER.
</b>
<b>     EXT. WOODS - DAY
</b>
     The WHITE LEADER is disrupted by a fogged image in BLACK &
     WHITE. The image settles into a ECU of Wayne. He's being
     filmed by a 16mm CAMERA that he is presently balancing on a
     fence post.

     This entire SCENE is played out cinema verite. The SOUND is not
     in sync as Wayne steps back into a MED SHOT. He looks directly
     into the CAMERA.

<b>                               WAYNE
</b>                    This is Wayne Gayle. I'm wounded and
                    my crew, Roger and Scott, are dead.
                    This may be out of sync 'cause we are
                    shooting with a wild camera and a
                    standard recorder we found in the van.
                    Mickey Knox's plan worked. We walked
                    out the front door, into my news van
                    and made our getaway. When we were
                    followed by patrol cars, Mallory Knox
                    killed Deputy Sheriff Duncan Homolka
                    and tossed his body out of the back.
                    Mickey told authorities over my police
                    band that I would surely be next if
                    they didn't give up the pursuit. They
                    took Mickey at his word and called off
                    the pursuit. Why helicopters weren't
                    employed, I don't know. My only
                    thought is it all happened too fast for
                    arrangements to be made. We've just
                    pulled off to the side of the road to
                    do this interview. Tensions run high--

     Mickey screams O.S.

<b>                               MICKEY (O.S.)
</b>                    We ain't got all fuckin' day!

<b>                               WAYNE
</b>                    Without any further ado, Mickey and
                    Mallory...

     Wayne steps forward and picks up the CAMERA and while conducting
     his interview, the CAMERA remains hand held.

     CAMERA focuses on Mallory sitting on a stump, while Mickey paces
     in and out of FRAME in the B.G.

<b>                               WAYNE
</b>                    Mallory, what did you think of Mickey's
                    plan? Did you think it would work?

<b>                               MALLORY
</b>                    It wasn't 'till we got on the ground
                    floor that I totally realized they
                    weren't gonna shoot unless we shot
                    first. When we got out of the
                    stairwell, I remember thinking, 'Oh my
                    God. This might work.' But
                    Mickey knew it would work all along.
                    There wasn't any doubt in his mind.
                    It's not like there was and he just
                    didn't show it. He knew it would work.

<b>                               WAYNE (O.S.)

<b>                               MALLORY
</b>                    I wondered how long it would be before
                    we'd get to be alone together. And I
                    wondered if I could wait that long.

<b>                               WAYNE (O.S.)

                    was kismet. We didn't even know those
                    people. How are we supposed to
                    organize a riot when we've been in
                    fuckin' isolation for the past year?
                    Just bleep out the fucks and jack
                    shits.
                         (laughs)
                    I mean, it's not like we care. If they
                    wanna say we masterminded the whole
                    thing, let 'em. It won't exactly keep
                    us up at night. But you said you
                    wanted the truth, and the truth is we
                    were just lucky.

     Mickey's snapping his fingers in the B.G.

<b>                               MICKEY
</b>                    C'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up.

<b>                               WAYNE (O.S.)
</b>                    So, what now?

<b>                               MALLORY
</b>                    Well, now me and Mickey are gonna take
                    it easy. Just enjoy each other's
                    company, stop and smell the roses,
                    notice the color purple, stuff like
                    that.

<b>                               WAYNE (O.S.)
</b>                    How do you intend to disappear? you're
                    probably the most famous couple in
                    America.

<b>                               MALLORY
</b>                    Well, back in slave times they had a
                    thing called the underground railroad.
                    And we got a whole fan club out there
                    just waiting to be conductors.
                         (to the camera)
                    So, you kids out there, keep the faith.
                    Cause Mickey and Mallory will be comin'
                    to your town real soon.

<b>                               MICKEY
</b>                    Okay, that's enough. End of interview.
                    We gotta move.

     Mickey approaches Wayne. CAMERA goes a little haywire as Wayne
     lowers it from his eye.

<b>                               WAYNE (O.S.)
</b>                    Okay, just let me swing around and film
                    myself asking the questions. And then
                    I'll do my little wrap up.

     Mickey takes the CAMERA from Wayne, and while he speaks, he
     balances it on a fence post.

<b>                               MICKEY
</b>                    Oh, we're gonna do a little wrap up,
                    all right. But it won't be you starin'
                    in the camera, looking dumb, and acting
                    stupid. Instead, you're gonna be
                    starin' down the barrels of our
                    shotguns and we're gonna be pullin' the
                    triggers.

     Wayne forces a chuckle. Mickey steps away from the CAMERA and into
     a THREE SHOT. The NEWS VAN is parked in the B.G.

<b>                               WAYNE
</b>                    That's a joke right?

     Mickey pumps the slide of his shotgun. Mallory grabs her
     shotgun from off the ground.

<b>                               WAYNE
</b>                    Just wait one fucking minute.

<b>                               MICKEY
</b>                    I said I'd give you a interview. Now
                    unless I'm mistaken, we just did a
                    interview.
                         (to Mallory)
                    We did an interview, didn't we?

<b>                               MALLORY
</b>                    Looked like an interview to me.

<b>                               MICKEY
</b>                    I said we'd give you an interview. I
                    never said we wouldn't kill you.

<b>                               WAYNE
</b>                    Wait! I don't know, but I kinda felt
                    during this...this whole escape that
                    a kind of bond--

     Wayne is shaking.

<b>                               WAYNE
</b>                         (continues)
                    ...developed between the three of
                    us. We're kindda in this together,
                    don't ya think?

<b>                               MICKEY
</b>                    No. Not really.

<b>                               WAYNE
</b>                    Don't touch those triggers! Please. I
                    think I've already proven that a live
                    Wayne Gayle is much more better that a
                    dead...Way-- Gayle. I was your
                    passport out of jail, not Duncan
                    Homolka. But me! I'll be your
                    passport outta---

<b>                               MICKEY
</b>                    Just save your breath, Wayne. We hate
                    you. If anybody in the fuckin' world
                    deserves to die, it's you.

     Wayne is grasping for anything.

<b>                               WAYNE
</b>                    Wait! You can't kill me. Mickey and
                    Mallory always leave somebody alive to
                    tell the tale.

<b>                               MICKEY
</b>                    We are.
                         (points to camera)
                    Your camera.

     Mickey turns to Mallory.

<b>                               MICKEY
</b>                         (John Wayne voice)
                    Let's make a little music, Colorada.

<b>                               WAYNE
</b><b>                    NO!!!
</b>
     The two interview subjects start PUMPING rounds into Wayne,
     who's body dances like a puppet before collapsing to the ground.

     Mickey and Mallory kiss each other passionately, then climbing
     into the news van, they drive away.

     Wayne's body lay peacefully in FRAME until the CAMERA
     eventually runs out of film.
