               As presentation credits begin, we hear Johnny Cash's "Home 
               of the Blues." Then we see Allison's name, under it Alex's, 
               under that Robert's, under that Quentin's, then under that 
               the title logo for Four Rooms, followed by "Starring Tim 
               Roth as the Bellboy." Then "The Guests" listed in alphabetical 
               order of all the actors playing guests. After the actors' 
               names, we...

<b>               FADE UP ON A WALL
</b>
               The camera pans down a weathered wall covered with postcards 
               from Miami Beach, Florida, the Copacabana, N.Y.C., "Wish You 
               Were Here" from Niagara Falls, rickshaws and babes on beaches, 
               etc....

               The camera comes to rest on an old photograph of a 1930s 
               hotel, the "Mon Signor," in its heyday, with a full staff of 
               30 people posed on the lawn in front.

               An old guy with a staccato voice delivers a monologue:

</b>                         There used to be a staff of fifty in 
                         this place. I'm the only one left 
                         from those days. It all comes down 
                         to one sap: the night-shift bellhop, 
                         that's me. What the hell is a bellhop? 
                         You know where the name comes from?
                              (silence)
                         Of course not... It's so simple it's 
                         stupid. They ring a bell and you 
                         hop. You hop to front and center. No 
                         heroes in this line, kid. Just men 
                         doing a job. No questions asked, 
                         none answered. I try to keep it 
                         simple, kid, not too personal...

               Another voice of a young man interrupts.

                         to come down at night and doze off 
                         in the kitchen. She liked the sound 
                         of the fans out back spinning around.

                         he goes to the bathroom, kid?

                         word for it.

               A wisp of smoke passes over a napkin pinned to the wall with 
               a lip print on it signed "Marilyn." The camera pulls back to 
               reveal Ted and the Old Guy sitting on a foldout cot in a 
               small back room of the Hotel Mon Signor. The old man is 
               dressed in a striped T-shirt with a bellhop's cap on. He 
               looks like an old pirate. Next to him on the bed sits Ted, a 
               young guy with a bellhop jacket draped over his knees. The 
               old bellhop takes a long drag off a big cigar.

                         wrapped in Miami. I get a box of 
                         them every Christmas from the chairman 
                         of the board. I think he sends them 
                         to me to keep my mouth shut. It's 
                         tough not to get a little personal 
                         in this business.

               The old bellhop takes a hit off his cigar and stares down at 
               his cap, lost in thought.

               The old guy passes the cap over to Ted.

               Ted puts the cap on.

                         wore that thing for fifty years. You 
                         keep it.

               The Old Guy gets up from the bed and throws a jacket on. 
               Pulls a few postcards off the wall, throws them in an old 
               straw suitcase, and slams the lid down. He heads for the 
               door. Ted follows.

                         hookers, and marital disputes.

               The Old Guy pauses for a second and looks Ted dead in the 
               eye.

               The door slams shut on the back room.

<b>               INT. HOTEL LOBBY--TWILIGHT
</b>
               The big empty lobby of the Mon Signor. You can tell that at 
               one point this used to be a swank place. It still is, kinda. 
               It's also kinda decrepit. The concierge -- a snappy, fast-
               talking, red-haired young woman in a blue blazer named Betty -- 
               stands behind the reception desk. The old man, suitcase in 
               hand, makes a beeline through the lobby, heading toward the 
               front door. Betty sees him.

               The Old Guy stops in his tracks and turns around.

               puffs away.

               Betty is left standing in the lobby. Ted appears behind her

                         parties. You got about three people 
                         checking in tonight, that's it. The 
                         only variable is Chester Rush in the

                         in last night. They're in the 
                         penthouse. The only reason I refer 
                         to it as a variable is that he's a 
                         movie star. Ya never know about movie

<b>               EXT. THE MON SIGNOR HOTEL--DUSK

               Ted, the bellboy, meets his first guest of the evening, as a 
               taxi unloads her luggage. To his warm surprise, the guest is 
               a Beautiful Mediterranean Goddess (actually, we will come to 
               see she is not technically a goddess, but a High Priestess). 
               She is about 25 years old, speaks with an Italian accent and 
               is dressed in Gypsy garb. She is Athena.

               Ted takes Athena's luggage onto his cart. But one item in a 
               woven Moroccan bag proves to be unbearably heavy. Athena is 
               concerned as he attempts to lift it.

                         have no idea...

               Ted strains as he uses all his cojones to lift the insanely 
               heavy bag onto the cart. Athena tips the cab driver, stingily. 
               The driver winces and gets in the cab. Ted has now managed 
               with grunts and groans and strained blood vessels to put 
               this thing on the cart. The cab skids away. Athena looks at 
               Ted, who is out of breath.

               As if she can't help herself, Athena's eyes are strangely 
               drawn to his crotch.

               She frowns, confused by this impulse. Ted appears to be 
               charmingly oblivious.

               Athena looks back into his face.

               Ted touches his face -- as if searching for the "purple" in 
               it -- and moves the cart inside, discreetly checking out his 
               crotch and giving her a confused side glance.

               her Gold Card and smiles.

               The doors open and Ted and Athena emerge upon the third floor. 
               Ted follows Athena with the cart down the hallway to her 
               room.

<b>               AT THE HONEYMOON SUITE DOOR

               Ted opens the door, then lifts the easiest bags first. In 
               the center of the room is a Jacuzzi with hokey plastic cupids 
               poised with urns on each side. A dormant fireplace looms 
               beyond the still hot tub.

               Ted stares at the heavy bag with anxiety -- then looks in 
               front of him to Athena as she rubs the round plastic head of 
               a little Cupid and mumbles, "Perfect."

               Then, arms open wide, chin lifted to heaven, eyes closed, 
               she mumbles a faint incantation. Then she does a belly-dance 
               wiggle and turns to Ted, who is truly perplexed.

               He starts to lift it, again straining and turning purple. He 
               laughs sickly.

               She relieves him of the task and effortlessly picks up the

               Ted is stunned as she slings the bag over her shoulder and 
               pauses to pull a 10 spot out of her cleavage. She hands it 
               to him. Ted is grateful and disoriented.

               Ted nods, confused by "the others," and walks off with the 
               cart. Then he turns from outside the doorway.

                         turn on the Jacuzzi.

               But Athena is ahead of him -- she flips a switch and water 
               begins to flow from the baby cupids' urns into the hot tub.

                         huh. Go now.

               As she says this, the door closes with a strange force, 
               shutting Ted out. Athena takes the bag to the bedroom of the 
               suite.

</b>
               A round bed with pink tuck'n'roll headboard. It's impossible 
               to imagine having an orgasm in this room -- unless it were 
               achieved by laughing.

               Athena carefully removes a large, beautiful white slab of 
               stone from her tapestry bag. She caresses it and carries it 
               like a baby to the bed and places it in the very center, the 
               head of the rock resting on dusty heart-shaped pillows.

               Then she removes from her bag a pink negligee and matching 
               high-heeled slippers.

               And these she places with reverence on the bed.

                         pool, but it will be under the setting

               Just as Ted is recovering from the mystery of this first 
               guest, Elspeth arrives.

               She has skin like marble, the body of Venus, piercing blue 
               eyes, blond hair and is dressed all in black clothing, like 
               Honey West in a rubber dress. She carries several bags, and 
               a silver sword on her shoulder.

               Then she snaps, irritated, behind her.

               ANGLE ON a young punk rocker chick with long orange hair, a 
               long leather coat, wearing a tight T-shirt with studs spelling 
               "PUSSY" across her breasts. This is Kiva.

               Kiva is kicking the tar and nicotine outta the cigarette 
               machine. Just as Ted's eyes grow wide with anxiety, several 
               packs of smokes drop into the juvenile delinquent's hands.

                         the Rock of Gibraltar?

               She stares at him without humor. He fumbles for the key. He 
               walks around the desk to help her with her black crocodile 
               luggage. Jars clang inside. He is ready to go, but Elspeth 
               turns to lecture Kiva on the hazards of smoking, as Kiva 
               lights up.

                         addicted to it, and I don't want the 
                         same thing to happen to you.

               As Kiva goes off on her impression of a game-show host, 
               Elspeth is growing increasingly rageful, like a mother with 
               an unruly child. Ted waits, luggage in hand.

               Ted looks on uneasily at the relationship that is beginning 
               to unfold here.

               Elspeth checks his reaction and becomes self-conscious at 
               his scrutiny.

<b>                                     ELSPETH

                         who... cares about you --

               But her wild child looks off, bored. Elspeth turns to Ted, 
               flustered.

<b>                                     ELSPETH
</b>                         Please -- take us to our room!

               Ted smiles uneasily and reaches to relieve her of her sword, 
               but Elspeth quickly slams her palm on the sword and shoots 
               him a piercing glare. He jumps back with a light nervous 
               laugh. He leads the way to the elevator.

<b>               AT THE HONEYMOON SUITE DOOR
</b>
               The couch has been set out here in the hall, as well as coffee 
               tables, lamps, and the TV. Elspeth and Kiva enter the room. 
               Athena is gone. As Ted stumbles around the furniture in the 
               hall, he peers in the room and see a transformation. With 
               most of the furniture removed, candles and incense and flowers 
               are beginning to form an altar around the fireplace.

               But oddest of all is the pink-tinged water swirling in the 
               Jacuzzi and pouring from the cupid urns. A sprinkle of white 
               powder on the carpet encircles the hot tub. Elspeth hands 
               him a tip as he gawks at the circle.

                         bringing her cat.

               Ted starts away again, perplexed. He turns for one last look 
               to see Elspeth kneeling before Kiva, who sprawls on the floor. 
               He shakes his head and leaves.

                         will interfere with our ritual.

               Kiva looks around the room and spies the TV in the hallway. 
               She turns to Elspeth with sarcastic concession.

</b>                         Okay... Mommy.

               Elspeth bristles as the brat saunters off to the bedroom. 
               Elspeth enters the sacred circle, stands before the altar, 
               whips out her sword, and makes a ceremonial gesture pointing 
               the sword upward, perfectly centered between her breasts.

               Kiva, behind Elspeth's back, exits from the bedroom doorway 
               into the hall and comes back in, lugging the TV into the 
               honeymoon bedroom.

               Elspeth kneels before the altar. Athena enters the room with 
               the "cleansed" artifact and lays the slab in the center of 
               the altar upon the heart-shaped pillows as Elspeth lays her 
               sword next to the rock. The women look upon the union with 
               tender affection.

               Athena stands up but her reverie is dispelled as she shrieks! 
               Loud TV suddenly blasts from the bedroom and Kiva the brat 
               is trying on the pink negligee over her clothes. Athena takes 
               the negligee off the irrepressible youth.

                         be one of your kind, but she is not

               The women have a stare-down. Then Athena calls out --

               Elspeth becomes anxious with jealousy. Athena is exasperated 
               as she firmly demands from Elspeth --

               Elspeth defers to Athena with remembered reverence and 
               respect. She bows apologetic and scurries to the bedroom.

               And saying this, she kisses Kiva's nose and leaves the room. 
               Kiva is quieted now. As Elspeth closes the bedroom door, she 
               has the last word.

               The doors open and Ted pushes a cart of expensive designer 
               luggage -- and lots of it -- behind yet another Gorgeous 
               Gal. This one is Jezebel, a Southern beauty, fawning over 
               her cat, as she carries nothing else, and proceeds down the 
               hall like a Southern princess.

                         darlin' Hi-dee, girls...

               Ted carries all her bags inside awkwardly. Again, the place 
               has become all the more transformed with wild canopies of 
               exotic cloths and fixings. Elspeth and Athena are hard at 
               work on a strange nature sculpture as Jezebel enters. She 
               stands inside the powdered circle and before the hot tub, 
               which now has dark blue water swirling inside. She presents 
               her cat -- upward toward heaven -- frees the cat, bares her

               Ted settles the bags down, hoping for a peek at her charms, 
               but her back is to him. The kitty rubs on her leg. She picks 
               it up and presses it against her bare breasts, petting it 
               sweetly. She winks and hands him a tip.

               And saying this, she shoos him away. Through the glass doors

               She climbs up the stairs, trying to pull the brat to her 
               feet.

</b>                         Kiva, don't do this to me.

               Kiva sees a bit of weakening here; she takes her feet out of 
               the Jacuzzi. She begins to speak softly.

<b>                                     KIVA

                         like it... you know what I mean... 
                         remember...?

               Elspeth begins to weaken. But continues to pull the brat up. 
               Kiva pours on softer seduction.

                         with the egg whites and the kilt.

               Elspeth is now fully seduced. Kiva takes Elspeth's hand and 
               presses it lightly on her face.

<b>                                     ELSPETH
</b>                         You mean... like last week?

               Kiva nods. Elspeth is enthralled, but from a disgusted "ick" 
               sound from Jezebel, Elspeth realizes she's revealing this 
               side of her life -- in front of her coven. She nervously 
               looks around and see all the coven looking at her: a disgusted 
               Jezebel, an understanding Raven, a preoccupied Eva and an 
               impatient and stern Athena.

               Elspeth comes to her senses, straightens her posture.

                         No!

               She turns on Elspeth and bites her hand. Elspeth pulls her 
               arm away and grabs Kiva by the hair.

               Elspeth lets go of Kiva's hair. Kiva jerks away from her.

               Kiva stomps off into the bedroom.

                         over, can we start the goddamn ritual --
                         pleeze?

               Elspeth enters the powered circle. Each girl takes off her 
               shoes. They anoint themselves with oils.

<b>                                     ATHENA
</b>                         We are communing here on New Year's 
                         Eve to bring to life the great goddess 
                         Diana, who was turned to stone in 
                         this very room forty years ago today.

               The girls moan in sleepy, eerie agreement as they begin to 
               sway within the circle.

<b>                                     ATHENA

                         undo the wicked spell which deprived 
                         you of the seed of your lover, your 
                         virginal blood, of your very life. 
                         We now form the symbolic rock with 
                         our bodies.

               And saying this, the girls all form a "rock" with their bodies 
               gracefully draped one upon the other. Music begins, and slowly 
               they start to unfold from the rock.

               The girls each find their place in a semicircle around the 
               Jacuzzi. Some bare their breasts, other strip off a layer of 
               clothes. They anoint their arms with water from the Jacuzzi.

               They begin a lovely dance, snaking their way around the 
               semicircle. The first one to go from one end to the other is 
               Athena. She then proceeds up the stairs and positions herself 
               between the altar and the Jacuzzi. She steps forth with a 
               bottle to the altar and pours it into the Jacuzzi.

               Each of the girls moans eerily. Athena places the bottle on 
               the altar and bows away. She joins the circle as Elspeth now 
               steps forward with her offering in a vial.

               The girls moan loudly as they sway. Jezebel places her 
               offering in the hot tub and bows out, returning to the circle. 
               Now Raven comes forth with a small leather canteen. She 
               unscrews the lid as she offers in her opiate stupor.

               She pours liquid into the mix, as the witches moan. Now it's 
               Eva's turn. Eva continues to sway, not moving forth to the 
               altar. The girls keep their eyes closed as they sway, waiting 
               for Eva's offering. Athena finally gives her a push and she 
               goes.

               Eva kneels before the altar. She produces a silver bottle 
               with a chain on its cap and neck. She timidly begins to 
               incant.

               Ted opens the door. His eyes bulge out as he looks upon the 
               fleshly feast. He steps back. They giggle seductively, all 
               except Eva, who sniffles, red-eyed.

               Amazingly, Ted's attention is captivated by Eva's sorrow, 
               not by the naked charms of the other witches. She shyly covers 
               her breasts. Sensitive to her shame and sorrow, he looks 
               away and steps from the door to fetch the room-service cart. 
               Athena directs the others to put on their shirts. Ted wheels

               fact that he would have to pass by the bathroom door. Ted 
               paces back and forth in front of Angela, who struggles to 
               get his attention. He whips around and they face off in what 
               appears to be a game of charades. Ted finally gets the point 
               and cautiously removes the gag from Angela's mouth. Angela 
               spits an old sock out.

               Sigfried suddenly comes to life... He's heard from the

               The directness of Sigfried's command, coupled with the SOUND 
               of a trigger being cocked, forces Ted to approach Angela. 
               Angela is a stunning beauty, and Ted being kind of a shy guy 
               makes for an awkward situation. Ted leans forward. As he

                         put the whole bloody mess behind

               Sigfried holds onto Ted's hand. The soft sound of distant 
               fireworks pops in the background. Car horns and a muffled 
               countdown signal that it's New Year's.

               Sigfried moves uncomfortably close to Ted and from out of 
               nowhere bolts forward, planting a wet kiss right on Ted's 
               mouth. Something snaps in Sigfried. He is either really 
               getting off on this or he is caught in the grips of a seizure. 
               He doubles back on the floors. Ted and Angela watch as he 
               flops around like a flounder with the cocked gun waving all 
               over the place. Ted wipes his mouth with his jacket sleeve 
               while trying to dodge the barrel of the gun.

               Ted enters the bathroom, which appears shaken by an 
               earthquake. Towels and wet clothes are all over the place. 
               An evening gown is flushed halfway down the toilet and pills 
               are everywhere. Sigfried is shouting from the other room to 
               hurry. Ted checks the cabinet, searching for a bottle marked 
               "Nitro." No luck.

               Ted spots a small window set above the toilet.

               He figures this is the best chance he's got to make a break.

               Ted goes for it. He manages to get his head and one arm 
               through the window before he gets stuck. His legs dangle in 
               the bathroom. Struggle as he may, he can only hit the toilet-
               bowl lever, which sends a loud FLUSH SOUND out through the 
               apartment.

                              distance)
                         It's no time to take a leak, Teddy, 
                         I'm fucking dying here!

<b>               EXT. BATHROOM WINDOW--NIGHT
</b>
               Outside the window, Ted's in another world. He's almost safe. 
               It's a strange feeling, kind of like bathing in warm water 
               in paradise, knowing a huge shark is ready to rip his ass 
               off. He can see the flickering red glowing light from the 
               witches' room from the floor below.

<b>               EXT. BATHROOM WINDOW AND BELOW--NIGHT
</b>
               Ted sees Eva bopping naked past the window. He shouts her 
               name out, to no avail.

               The MUSIC drowns out his voice and they ignore his calls for 
               help. The blood rushes to his head. He lets himself hang 
               there for a moment. He wonders how many other people have 
               found themselves in situations like this before him. Probably 
               everyone. Right next to his face, Ted recognizes a bloody 
               hand print. It's not his blood.

<b>               EXT. BATHROOM WINDOW AND ABOVE--NIGHT
</b>
               Ted hears a sound from above and twists himself around, 
               spotting a young man (previously seen as the Yuppie Scumbag 
               on the phone) leaning out of the window directly above him. 
               After a quick moment of sizing him up, Ted gathers himself.

               No answer. Something's wrong with the guy, all the blood is 
               drained from his face and he is mumbling something.

                         but would you be so kind as to get 
                         help? Could you call the police, 
                         please?

               Silence.

                         You okay?

               The young man manages to belt out the word "ice" just before 
               hurling a mouthful of vomit toward Ted. It takes all Ted's 
               strength to dodge the puke and pull himself back into the 
               bathroom. He falls back on the floor.

               He props himself up and checks for damage. He notices 
               something odd... the room is silent. No Sigfried. He walks 
               into the bedroom.

               Ted looks around the still room. No one's there.

               He heads toward the door and, from out of the corner of his 
               eye, he spots Sigfried's hairy leg. Sigfried has passed out 
               on the floor. Angela's chair has been knocked on its side. 
               Ted races over to help lift her back up. He pulls the gag 
               from her mouth. Angela jumps all over him.

               Ted turns on a dime and runs smack into Sigfried, who's been 
               taking in the whole conversation.

                         Ted. If you told me, it would no

                         are all you got. In the end, when 
                         all the people you knew are dead and 
                         gone, all you'll have left are you

                         dust to dust -- all the anger,

                         It could be as small as a little 
                         spark, but it will cut a path straight 
                         through all that blackness, straight 
                         to you. It could be another boat, or 
                         some distant fire on an island, but 
                         that light will shed a shining path 
                         of diamonds cutting through mile 
                         after mile of darkness to lie at 
                         your feet. That's love, Ted, it's 
                         like a path of light in an ocean of 
                         darkness.

               Ted and Sigfried stare out of the window in peace, transfixed 
               by the glimmering lights of the city. A loud SHOT rings out, 
               shattering the still moment. The two men spin around. Angela 
               stands there with a smoking gun hanging at her side.

               Sigfried drops to his knees. Ted checks him out, no blood. 
               Angela has fired the gun into the floor below. Ted looks up 
               at Angela. Angela opens the chamber of the pistol and hands 
               the bullets to Ted.

                         killed anybody downstairs.

               Sigfried is bent over, silently weeping on the floor.

               Angela sits next to Sigfried and gently strokes his back.

               Ted slowly walks toward the door and takes one last look at 
               the strange couple at rest in the corner of the room before 
               closing the door behind him.

               suddenly realizes who this guy is and whips around, shouting

<b>               ROOM 716
</b>
               CLOSE-UP of a cigarette hanging out of a Man's mouth as he 
               speaks into the telephone.

<b>                                     MAN
</b>                         Bottle of Moet et Chandon. Fast.

               Man hangs up the phone and stubs out his cigarette into an 
               already overstuffed ashtray by the bed. Man turns around to 
               face the camera. He is a dark and handsome Latin male in his 
               mid-30s. Dangerous. Impatient.

               He walks toward the camera as he continues straightening his 
               tie.

               He stops at the door of the bathroom and watches his Wife 
               and two kids get ready for the party. Wife seems to be a 
               beautiful woman in her mid-30s. The children are Sarah, nine, 
               and Juancho, six.

               Man strikes up another cigarette and finishes his tie.

               He watches his Wife comb Juancho's hair down and to the side 
               like an idiot.

               Not being able to stand it anymore, Man tears Juancho away 
               from his Wife and snatches the comb.

<b>                                     MAN

               Man begins to slick Juancho's hair back.

<b>                                     MAN
</b>                         There... see? You look cool with 
                         your hair up like this. Like me...

               Juancho is smiling now. He's happy he's going to look like 
               his dad.

<b>                                     MAN
</b>                         Not down and to the side, all stupid 
                         like your mom likes to comb it.

               Juancho looks over at Sarah, who is going through the tortuous 
               ritual of having her mother brush the tangles out of her 
               long, unmanageable hair.

               Wife seems to be taking out her aggressions on the tangled 
               mess.

               Man is starting to have problems of his own with Juancho's 
               hair. Juancho's hair is thinner than Man's, so it won't stay 
               up.

               Man puts down his cigarette in order to get a better handle 
               on it. We see the frustration growing in his face.

               Juancho picks up the cigarette and pretends he's smoking 
               too, just like his dad.

               Man tears the cigarette away from Juancho and smokes it down 
               to the filter. He looks at his own cool hair, and then down 
               at Juancho's, which won't stay up.

               Man flicks the cigarette butt into the toilet in frustration.

               In anger, Man starts messing up Juancho's hair.

</b>                         I can't do anything with it.

               Furious, Man simply swipes Juancho's hair back down and to 
               the side, the way Wife had it before. Juancho looks like an 
               idiot again.

<b>                                     MAN
</b>                         There. Go.

               Juancho slouches past everyone as he exits the bathroom.

               Sarah watches him leave as her own hair is finished.

                              clip in Sarah's hair)
                         There. Go.

               Sarah exits.

               Wife then finishes her own gorgeous hair. Man lights up a 
               new cigarette.

                         So, are we gonna have fun tonight?

               Man blows smoke in Wife's face as he walks out of the 
               bathroom.

</b>                         I didn't think so.

               Sarah has joined Juancho in watching television.

               Man watches the children watch TV. We can see the wheels 
               turning in Man's head.

               He turns back to the bathroom.

               He watches Wife now. Wheels turning. Practically burning 
               rubber.

               Angry, Sarah slams down the phone. She has an unusually adult 
               temper. We know where she gets it from. She looks up and 
               sees that the nudies are still in full force.

               She sticks her foot out for Juancho to smell. He's reluctant. 
               Fearful.

               He slowly, very slowly... climbs onto the bed and lowers his 
               head to her foot. Very slowly.

               Sarah waits until he's close enough to her foot before she 
               kicks him in the face, sending him somersaulting off the bed 
               and crashing to the floor.

               She grabs the remote control he left behind and changes the 
               channel to a cartoon.

               Juancho gets up and realizes his defeat. He decides to wander 
               about. Looking for something to do...

               Sarah tries to ignore him as he stalks the room. It's only a 
               matter of time before he finds mischief.

               Juancho sees the champagne bucket and Bingo!, he goes for 
               the bottle.

               Sarah opens her mouth, as if about to tell him to leave the 
               champagne alone. She stops herself when she realizes she 
               wants some champagne too.

               She quickly scrambles about for a bottle opener while Juancho 
               unwraps the bottle top.

               Sarah opens the dresser drawer with such force that a few 
               hidden contents long forgotten in the back of the drawer 
               slide forward.

               Some coins, a paperclip, and a hypodermic needle. She looks 
               down at the needle that lays beside the Gideon Bible and 
               casually picks the phone back up and punches 0. The phone 
               rings.

               A frustrated Ted hangs up the phone. He walks briskly to the 
               elevator.

               Sarah and Juancho are pouring themselves champagne. They 
               turn up the television and drink. Juancho shudders at the 
               taste, but tries to drink as much as Sarah.

               Sarah clearly doesn't like it, but tries to pretend she does.

               Sarah picks up an instruction card near the phone to see how 
               to make room-to-room calls.

               Juancho puts down his champagne glass and searches his 
               father's coat pocket. He finds a pack of cigarettes and takes 
               one out. He puts it in his mouth and pretends to smoke.

               Sarah checks out the hypodermic needle carefully. She has an

               Sarah stands atop the chest of drawers and uses the lipstick 
               to draw a bull's-eye on one of the hotel art paintings. She 
               writes numbers next to each circle representing points.

                         of the way!

               Sarah, a little tipsy now, grabs the needle and staggers to 
               the bed. She hears the key in the doorway and throws the 
               needle into the curtain to hide it.

               Ted enters the room, somewhat disheveled from his encounter 
               with Sigfried. He has a tray and a new bottle of champagne.

               He puts the champagne bottle into the empty bucket. He spots 
               the original bottle lying on the floor half empty and dripping 
               into the carpet.

               Sarah gives up and throws the cracker back onto the tray. 
               She's a little drunk.

               Ted picks up the ruined champagne bottle.

               Juancho dips his crackers and eats them. He makes a face and 
               drops a soggy cracker onto the tray.

               They go to the bathroom. Ted sits on the bed. Waits.

               He sees the painting on the wall but can't figure out what's 
               different about it.

               The red lipstick blends right into the aesthetic value of 
               the painting.

               Ted smells something funny. He looks down and sees the socks 
               on the bed. He grabs a fork from the tray and uses it to 
               throw the socks across the room.

               The kids come back out.

               The children lie in the bed, eyes closed, listening intently.

               Ted dips his fingers in the jar of vaporous ointment.

<b>               AFTER A MOMENT OF DARKNESS
</b>
               After a moment of darkness, the night is disturbed by the 
               loud crashing of fireworks outside the window.

               Sarah sits up, eyes closed. Her face feels the warmth coming 
               from the window and she tilts her head toward it.

               The light of the fireworks dances its reflections off her 
               face.

               She inhales deeply... then makes a sour face. She goes for 
               the bathroom, arms outstretched like a blind girl. She gets 
               to the bathroom, turns on the light, and searches for the 
               sink.

               She begins to wash the ointment off her eyes very carefully. 
               She dries her eyes thoroughly and opens them... checks them 
               in the mirror. A little red, but otherwise fine.

               She goes back into the bedroom, turns on the television and 
               grabs the new champagne bottle. She shakes it violently.

               Juancho wakes. He turns his head to her. His eyes are still 
               closed.

               The champagne bottle explodes. She pours herself a glass.

</b>                         Yep. If you wanna watch too, you 
                         have to go wash your face.

               Juancho gets up smiling and tries to run to the bathroom. He 
               slams into the wall, hard.

<b>                                     SARAH
</b>                         Be careful...

               Juancho walks into the bathroom a little slower, more 
               cautious.

               Sarah pours herself another glass. She downs the glass and 
               shudders.

               She smells the bad smell again. Only now she really smells 
               it.

               She smells her feet. Nothing. She smells the champagne. 
               Nothing.

               Juancho enters the room and sits on the bed. Sarah grabs his 
               foot and smells it.

               She drops his foot.

               Juancho stares blankly at her.

               Sarah looks down at the mattress. She smells the mattress.

               Juancho looks at her as if she's drunk.

               Sarah leaps off the bed and turns on the room lights. She 
               takes a huge swig from the champagne bottle, then stalks 
               toward the mattress.

               Juancho leaps off the bed as well and stands back.

               Sarah pulls the mattress off of the bedsprings enough to see 
               what is underneath it.

               Juancho screams. Sarah is too stunned to scream. Stuffed 
               into the bedsprings is a woman's dead and beaten corpse.

               Ted bursts into the room. He sees the disarray.

               Ted tries to pull the syringe out of his leg, but yanking it 
               makes it break in two, the plunger in his hand, and the needle 
               still stuck in his leg.

               Ted staggers and grabs hold of the dead woman's foot for 
               support as he steps on the remote control, flipping the TV 
               on to the Nudie channel, just as...

               Man opens the door.

               Man stands at the door, drunk Wife unconscious on one arm, 
               the door knob in the other hand. He's looking mean.

               Man's POV: focused on the dead woman in the bedsprings. We 
               pan up the dead woman's leg to find Ted holding her foot. We 
               pan down Ted's leg to find the hypodermic needle jutting 
               out... then pan over to the other hand holding the broken 
               syringe plunger.

               We pan over to the Nudie channel, then down to the fire 
               blazing behind the children. Pan up to the dripping champagne 
               bottle in Sarah's hand, then over to the cigarette hanging 
               out of Juancho's mouth. Juancho tosses his cigarette out of 
               his mouth to an area behind him. Another blaze starts 
               immediately.

               Man drops his Wife to the floor.

               In the WIDE SHOT of Ted and the children, we see that the 
               fireworks are bursting big and bright outside the window 
               behind them. Almost as bright as the flames eating through 
               the room.

               Man simply glares at Ted. Finally Man speaks...

                         my face and forces me to play out 
                         some psychosexual drama with his 
                         wife.

                         716. There's a scary Mexican gangster 
                         dude pokin' his finger in my chest. 
                         There's his hooligan kids snapping 
                         their fingers at me. There's the

                         stuffed in the springs of a bed. 
                         There're rooms blazing afire... 
                         There's a needle from God knows where 
                         stuck in my leg, infecting me with 
                         God knows what, and finally, there's

               A RINGING SOUND happens that we haven't heard before. Ted's 
               head turns toward it.

               It's the guest board. And the top light, the penthouse, is 
               ringing. It rings where all the others buzzed.

               Betty can hear it distinctly on her side of the line. The 
               sound fully wakes her up. They start talking Howard Hawks 
               style again.

                         this hotel. In fact, he is the most 
                         important guest at the hotel. The 
                         Mon Signor used to be a haven for 
                         movie stars. Through the thirties 
                         and forties, and the first half of 
                         the fifties, more movie stars -- if 
                         you break it down on a night-by-night 
                         basis -- stayed at the Mon Signor 
                         than any other hotel in Hollywood. 
                         Now, we had some hard time in the 
                         eighties, even though we were the 
                         official hotel of Cannon Pictures, 
                         but we're coming back strong in the 
                         nineties. And a movie star clientele 
                         is important to that comeback. If we 
                         can keep stars of his magnitude happy, 
                         we're on our way. So, Ted, just take 
                         care of him, then you can leave.

               The elevator door opens and Ted wheels out his tray into the 
               hallway.

               There's been a bit of an effort to make himself appear a bit 
               less disheveled than in the last scene. He's only minorly 
               successful in the attempt. His uniform still looks like shit, 
               his hair looks tousled, and he walks with a limp.

               He wheels the cart up to the penthouse door and KNOCKS at

               A woman opens the door, it's Angela from Alex's story.

<b>               INT. PENTHOUSE--NIGHT
</b>
               The penthouse is huge, far and away the best suite in the 
               house. And standing in the middle of the biggest room in the 
               hotel is the hottest, newest comedy star to burst onto the 
               Hollywood scene in nearly a decade: Chester Rush. At this 
               moment in time, he's the king, and he has the swagger of a 
               new king. After only one movie, he's pulled the sword out of 
               the stone. And the look on his face says, "King's good." 
               Surrounding him is his entourage. They all look like once 
               upon a time this evening they were dressed sharp; however, 
               at this late hour, everybody looks about as disheveled as 
               Ted.

               One of the lads, Norman, has planted roots in a comfy chair 
               with his leg thrown over the arm and a bottle of Jim Beam in 
               his hand.

               The second guy, Leo, is in the back of the room pacing back 
               and forth on the telephone. He is completely oblivious to 
               the rest of the room's activity.

               In Chester's hand is an ever present glass of champagne, 
               which he constantly spills as he gestures wildly. Around the 
               room are the leftovers: pizza boxes, fast-food hamburgers, 
               and empty bottles of Cristal Champagne.

                         when Norman thinks of bellboys, he 
                         thinks of Quadrophenia.

               But me, when I think of bellboys, I think of The Bellboy, 
               with Jerry Lewis. Didja ever see The Bellboy?

</b>                         You should, it's one of Jerry's better 
                         movies. He never says a word through 
                         the entire film. A completely silent 
                         performance. How many actors can 
                         pull that off? And he has to go to 
                         France to get respect. That says it 
                         all about America right there. The 
                         minute Jerry Lewis dies, every paper 
                         in this fuckin' country gonna write 
                         articles calling the man a genius. 
                         It's not right. It's not right and 
                         it's not fair. But why should that 
                         surprise anybody? When has America 
                         ever been fair? We might be right 
                         every once in a while, but we're 
                         very rarely fair.

               Ted wonders if he should have said that.

               Chester walks over to the table and pours himself some more 
               champagne. When he talks now it's slower and somewhat 
               distracted. The tone of the scene starts changing.

               Chester takes a drink of champagne, a disgusted look crosses 
               his face, and he slowly puts it down.

               His manner gives the room a chill.

               Everyone looks at him, not knowing what to say. Even Leo 
               walks over to witness. The whole room is uneasy and a little 
               frightened.

               When Chester finishes his tantrum, he turns his attention 
               back to Ted. As he talks to him, he opens up another bottle. 
               But it's not the rapid-pace delivery Chester has done so

               standing next to a beautiful 1964 red convertible Chevy 
               Corvelle. The headline reads: "Hollywood's Hottest New Star 
               Next to America's Hottest Old Car."

                         say: "The less a man makes declarative

                         look foolish in retrospect." Now 
                         there're some inherent obstacles in 
                         this undertaking. First of all, I'm 
                         not some sick fuck like Peter Lorre 
                         on that show, travelin' the

                         to lose his finger. We just wanna 
                         chop it off. So if fate doesn't smile

               Everybody gets in their position by the bar. Norman lays his 
               left hand on the block of wood with his pinky sticking out.

               In his right hand is his Zippo lighter, poised and ready to 
               strike.

               Chester hands Ted the meat cleaver.

               Ted takes it, raises it up above Norman's finger, in position.

               Everybody is crowded around the scene, on pins and needles.

               Norman looks hard at the Zippo in his hand. Ted, holding the 
               cleaver, stares focused on Norman's pinky.

               Norman readies himself.

               Places his thumb on the wheel in the Zippo.

               Takes a breath.

               And strikes.

               It sparks, but doesn't light.

               Without missing a beat, Ted brings down the cleaver, slicing 
               off Norman's pinky.

               Norman lets out a scream.

               Ted, in one move, lays down the cleaver, scoops up the money 
               and walks out the door.

<b>               INT. HALLWAY--AFTER DAWN
</b>
               CAMERA is positioned at far end of hallway, looking down it 
               at the elevator at the other end.

               Ted walks out of the penthouse in the f.g. In a MEDIUM SHOT, 
               he takes the thousand dollars in his hand, looks at it, 
               smiles, and sticks it in his pocket. It might've been a bad 
               night, but it's been a profitable one. He chuckles at the 
               irony, and, whistling a happy tune, turns his back on the 
               camera and walks down the hall to the elevator.

               All the while we hear PANDEMONIUM breaking out behind the 
               door.

               As Ted walks to the elevator, the CREDITS ROLL. He waits for 
               the elevator, it arrives, he gets in, the doors close.

               As CREDITS CONTINUE TO ROLL, we hold for about two beats... 
               then...

               The door BURSTS open and everybody comes piling out. 
               Everybody's screaming, yelling different things to one 
               another. Norman has a bloody towel wrapped around his hand, 
               he's screaming and crying.

               Chester has the bucket of ice with the finger in it. Leo's 
               trying to direct everything. Everybody's in frantic activity, 
               except for Angela, who stands back, drinks her drink, and 
               watches the show. They all run down the hall, toward the 
               elevator. Somebody trips and they all hit the ground. The 
               bucket of ice with the finger goes spilling. They run around 
               like crazy, looking for the finger and picking up ice cubes. 
               Norman lies on the floor and screams. They pick it all up, 
               get to the elevator, and push the button.

               When it arrives, they all dive in except for Angela.

                         fun.

               The doors close on the screaming maniacs.

               Angela walks through a door marked "Stairway."

               STEADICAM in front of her as she walks the halls, looking 
               for her room. She finds it...

               Angela sticks her key in the door, then stops when she sees 
               something approaching. The look on her face combines strange 
               awe and mild shock.

               Almost floating ethereally, a mysterious Blond Bombshell, 
               wearing Diana's see-through negligee and slippers, armed 
               with Elspeth's sword slung over her shoulder, wanders toward 
               her. She is in a daze, perhaps lost or drunk.

               The bombshell looks up at her dizzily.

                         Have you seen him?

               Angela and the girl have a strange moment as they connect 
               through the eyes.

               Having had enough emotional intensity tonight, Angela breaks 
               their eye contact.

               Diana quietly says, "Ohhh," as she drifts on down the hall 
               in a daze. Angela puts her hand to her temples before opening 
               her hotel door. She does a double-take on the hallway -- 
               empty.

               She pauses a beat, then walks into her room. After the door 
               closes, we hear Sigfried on the other side.
