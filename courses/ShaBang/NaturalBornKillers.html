My absolute favorite. Mickey and Mallory are so romantic ;)</p><hr><p><b>b-diz</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>I give a nine to the script.  To the actual film I give a one. The film doesn't even deserve a one. It's an awful piece of crap. I would not blame the actors at all. I blame Oliver Stone. He took a funny and quite enjoyable script and turned it into a borning peice of crap. The movie constantly cuts to seemingly random shit which renders it virtually unwatchable. I can see where using these techniques could possibly enhance a movie if used sparingly, but it is so chalk full of crap that there it delivers fatal blows to the story. One thing that Tarantino does well is tell a story. This movie isn't interested in telling stories, or being entertaining, it's busy trying to be "smart". I think Tarantino owes Oliver Stone a kick to the nuts for turning his script into this peice of crap. The one thing that actually was clever in the movie that was changed from the script was the part with Rodney Dangerfeild, who was great. The laugh track was pretty brilliant. That part of the movie was good, but the rest of it was a piece of shit.</p><hr><p><b>Ross</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>d-biz: I disagree strongly. I think your opinion is completely anal and you over analysed the film.

NBK is an all time classic and it's a pity for your head is so firmly stuck up your bum to appreciate it.</p><hr><p><b>jesse</b> <a href="mailto:revolution10_8@msn.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>I love Oliver Stone, I hate this movie. I almost turned it off in 5 minutes, Tommy Lee Jones is too good to be in this pile. Robert Downey as always is excellent, Tome Sizemore rules of course. Check out his website for you Tom fans out there. This movie just sucked on every level but a bunch of good actors get stuck in crap like this, it's not their fault I suppose. By the way, any of you scum who like serial killers you need to be cut wide open and drained. Peace I'm out!</p><hr><p><b>aidoe</b> <a href="mailto:adidoe66@hotmail.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Oliver Stone can't even direct traffic in an empty room. I give a one star rating  for the movie. To the script I give ten out of ten. Tarantino might not be the most technical writer in the guild, but he doesn't really have to be. The man has such a gift for dialogue, that he can let his characters just take over and create the movie for him. Tarantino hates Stone's version of his movie, who turned probably one of the greatest road movies of all time, even better than Bonnie and Clyde, into the most nonsensical piece of self righteous brain numbing crap I have ever seen. I love Juliette Lewis and if Tarantino had the opportunity to do this movie he'd still probably cast her as Mallory. Harrelson does his best, the rest of the cast can just rot in my eyes.</p><hr><p><b>tweaks</b> <a href="mailto:panicdiscofever2207@yahoo.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Stone is an awesome film director and his idea of the movie is timeless! Stone uses satire to show how America is obsessed with violence in the media by following two lovers/killers on a killing spree. As the spree continues more and more people become obsessed with the couple and their crimes causing them to be stars instead of criminals! B-diz, you're an idiot because you did not get the point of the film, just like many other people in America!</p><hr><p><b>loser</b> <a href="mailto:thetouched@hotmail.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Awesome movie! I love it WOOT.</p><hr><p><b>Bjarne</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>For a start, Jesse you don't know shit! If Tarantino even breathes on a movie its going to be good enough to watch the whole way through. 5 minutes! Actor obsessionist. Go home. I thought the movie excellent.</p><hr><p><b>Anna</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is amazing. It's incomprehensible to me that someone could dislike it. Unless they just didn't understand it. I believe everyone should see it, it's great.</p><hr><p><b>NickP_CY</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Tarantino rules. I love his style and methods. I like every script he writes or shoots. This is not just a movie. It is a masterpiece of artistic job! 
As for Oliver Stone, he is once again fantastic. The actors are also cool!</p><hr><p><b>Sidney022</b> <a href="mailto:Sidney022@yahoo.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I totally agree with Anna. The people giving this movie a low rating obviously didn't get it. This movie is a masterpeice. Woody Harelson and Juilette Lewis were amazing, as was the rest of the cast! 
You need to be able to read between the lines and pay attention to the symbolism being created in this film. This movie is even more relevant today with the explosion of sensationalism surrounding crazy celebrities in the media these days! </p><hr><p><b>travis</b> <a href="mailto:tharris99037@yahoo.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Ok, listen here jesse, i'll let you have your own opinion but let me ask you this: Do you like Pulp Fiction? I bet you you do if you had watched Natural Born Killers. So you really can't critize the killer thing going on, it's just a great movie with an authentic theme telling of serial killers. You should consider it better next time. If there are any major movie fans, try to find me and email me please, thank you.</p><hr><p><b>RAFFEX</b> <a href="mailto:raffe666@gmail.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Travis is right, Jesse isn't used to watching these types of movies. He probably likes to watch movies like "Titanic","Ghost","Forest Gump" and other popular pieces of shit like that, easy movies to understand that don't contain extremely strange and complex elements that isn't in your ordinary everyday movies. He's the kinda person who would say "Fight Club", "A Clockwork Orange", etc.. are stupid movies. Now that's a shame, people like these don't understand the true beauty of cinema.</p><hr><p><b>P. Richardson</b> <a href="mailto:Maverick_xero@hotmail.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/4-stars.gif> (4 out of 10 )<br>I love how any mention of failure towards Tarantino is just automatically shot down. One: I love action movies. Two: this is done differently than your average road movie. Three: There is a beat and style that "QT" is trying to hit on. But, all that said It did as Oliver Stone stated lack a sophistication that I feel is needed but Oliver Stone also could not bring that to the right level. That said I felt no need to understand and found them to merely be sick twisted basterds.  And "Fight Club"  and "A Clockwork Orange" are two different types of movies. One Fight Club tries to beef up the rule that fighting is what makes you man hurting each other and beating each other to a pulp. And Kubrick is a substance genius but "Orange" is just is infatuation with the psychotic personality of Alex read the book and then tell me that he didn't change its meaning. So in closing Tarantino is capable of failures just as Billy Wilder or Kubrick or even Scorsese (my favorite director of all time). But what this script does show is someone special was in the midst of being heard. </p><hr><p><b>AdamofNewcastle</b> <img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>Completely terrible film. Tarantino is so over-rated. The film drags on forever and is so over the top.. typical of Americans I suppose. The bird who plays woody's mrs is so ugly. It's so annoying to see them get away with murder so easy and is just not believable.</p><hr><p><b>Abraham</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Dbiz yes the script is a amazing and yes I think Tarantino would have done a much better job with the directing, but oliver stone did make this movie into more than a movie, it is an artform. Maybe if you could understand what all those so  called "random clips" were in the movie for then you'd understand that it was GENIUS not stupid. Watch it again and try and tell me you don't get it.</p><hr><p><b>GreaserRick</b> <a href="mailto:shipley_rick@yahoo.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I agree with allot of you, Oliver Stone turned a great script into something that is mediocre at best. The script is fantastic, the movie....not so much. The trippy weirdo hippy crap might've worked in The Doors but with such a colorful script, it distracts the viewer. True Romance was a movie that you know right off the bat was a Tarantino script, it had that vibe but NBK for me was LAME! When I was in line to see it at the movie theater a friend of mine came out of the previous showing. He talked about how it was a great movie was and he said that he saw it 3 times already. After watching it, I thought for sure he was joking but sadly he wasn't. I felt like I was tricked out of my admission money. Then I read the script and was blown away on how good it was. I firmly believe that if Oliver Stone wasn't involved with the movie it would be 100% better. Natural Born Killers is the only movie with Tarantino's name in it that I have seen only once and is the only one that I refuse to ever watch again. I give the script a 10 and the movie a 0.5. </p><hr><p><b>RevLime</b> <a href="mailto:revlucylime@gmail.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>I hate this movie. The very concept is just not well thought-out. I mean, sure, it's an interesting satire, but Quentin Tarantino HAD to know it wouldn't be understood, and he HAD to know there would be copycat killings. Come on, gratuitous violence, fame and a happy ending? It doesn't matter what it's trying to say. People are still going to misunderstand it and use it as inspiration. Besides, it's very pretentious and above-it-all.</p><hr><p><b>Tazz18</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I really wish everyone would stop being so critical and over analyzing this movie. The movie was a colorful, amazing, film. It had elements of everything, romance, drama, action, all of it. It was a great film and I especially appreciated it because of the crazy, spazzy, different cinematography.</p><hr><p><b>Paika</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>Tarantino's script was clever and fun, but juvenile and incomplete (I believe it was actually considered as a Clarence-penned movie-within-a-movie for True Romance, before Tony Scott signed on as director). I like what Stone did with it. It's biting satire and it still resonates. And can we raise ourselves just a notch above YouTube comment level? No wonder all you angry vapid people don't understand this film. It's about you.</p><hr><p><b>cameron </b> <a href="mailto:darthsitkur@aol.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This was an awesome crime action thriller, the action was nonstop, it was bloody and gory, and the big prison riot and the shoot em up prison break during the last 20 and a half minutes was freakin amazing, an instant 10/10, and I would love to see a crazier and uncut version of this movie.</p><hr><p><b>Cameron</b> <a href="mailto:Darthsitkur@aol.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I finally saw the director's cut and it is several times better than the theatrical version.</p><hr><p><b>Ricci Jermaine</b> <a href="mailto:jelmarvandermeervikingnl@gmail.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I hope you all understand that writing a script like this isn't easy, the tremendous work effort put in my Quentin Tarantino, especially in the underrated Inglourious Bastards, which took 11 years to write, should be respected and luckily 90% of the people here commented reasonably. I also hope that everyone can agree with me when I say that Tarantino is by far one of the most versatile and respected writers of our time. If anyone disagrees, please share an opinion. This is for all those pessimists, my opinion.</p><hr><p><b>anthony</b> <a href="mailto:stewart.anthony752@gmail.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>People please, the movie is supposed to deal with the psychological aspects of Mickey and Malory, how society is becoming morally bankrupt, that anybody can become famous, even Mass murders. It's easily one of the best films ever made. It's an Art film, not an action film.</p><hr></td>
