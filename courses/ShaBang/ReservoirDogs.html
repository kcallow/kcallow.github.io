In the movie, Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) is the one who doesn't want to tip, and Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) is the one arguing in favor of the waitresses.</p><hr><p><b>anonymous</b> <img src=/images/rating/6-stars.gif> (6 out of 10 )<br>I saw this after Kill Bill & Pulp Fiction so I was expecting a lot out of it. I wasn't impressed.</p><hr><p><b>Molly</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>They got the characters mixed up in the restaraunt scene. Mr Brown is the one talking about Madonna getting dicked, Mr. Pink Doesn't tip and Mr. Blue and White are supporting the waitresses. Dude.</p><hr><p><b>El dependiente</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>By far the best Tarantino movie.</p><hr><p><b>Marco</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I don't understand why in this script Mr. White says "I don't tip"! In the movie Mr. Pink says it! There are some errors.</p><hr><p><b>King Of KINGS</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I don't understand why Mr.Pink is talking about "Like A Virgin", in the movie it's Mr.Brown.</p><hr><p><b>Chris Witte</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Once in a great while a movie comes along that changes the way people look at movies. While effects and action do help to move a story along, if you don't have great dialogue, you don't have a great movie. This movie is an excellent example of a movie that didn't have a lot of funding, yet blew audiences away and holds a place with many people as one of the best films of the 90's. This is the movie you watch during the summer on those late nights and just marvel at how great it is. An ideal summer movie, genius performances out of the actors, brilliant writing and directing, and a stunning achievment. The dialogue is what makes this film. The action adds to the film's image. Reservoir Dogs will always be remembered. It will never be forgotten.</p><hr><p><b>Rick</b> <a href="mailto:daya.richardtakadjian@gmail.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>When Quentin originally wrote the script he wrote the part of Mr. Pink for himself. When production started however, he declined the role but wanted to still be able to give the "Like a Virgin" speech so they re-wrote that part of the script real quick.</p><hr><p><b>Z</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Yeah! Tarantino is brilliant.</p><hr><p><b>Paulson</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The best independent film ever in existence. How one man can create a classic from a modest budget and little experience is beyond reasoning. It's pure talent and all genius.</p><hr><p><b>Patrick</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>It's been done before. Lines get changed during production. It doesn't matter that Mr White didn't deliver the "I don't believe in tipping" speech. Steve Buscemi did a superb job. It actually fit his character better than Harvey Keitel's. Maybe the director noticed too. It's brilliant work by Tarentino.</p><hr><p><b>Andrea</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Awesome movie!</p><hr><p><b>Jeffrey</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Great movie! One of my all-time favorites!</p><hr><p><b>mr. Black</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>I renember watching a scene of it in 100 Greatest scary moments on telly, and I found the bit where he cut of the cops ear grusome. And the cop was tied to the chair and gagged. He was all bloody as well. Can someone else comment on what I said here.</p><hr><p><b>TheSkyNinja</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Mr. Pink is talking about "like a virgin" because tarantino wrote that part for him but later played mr. Brown instead. He probably felt that he could do that part the best. Effing best movie ever.</p><hr><p><b>Max</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>One of the best movies ever. Steve Buscemi and Harvey Keitel rule!</p><hr><p><b>Chris O'Connor</b> <img src=/images/rating/8-stars.gif> (8 out of 10 )<br>The only reason I gave this movie a 8/10, is because of the conversation over tipping. In my opinion, I thought it to be a terrific movie. All over the internet, people were saying the language, especially the word "Fuck" was used a lot. It was, but it wasn't THAT bad.</p><hr><p><b>Jimmy</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>You guys really need to stop commenting on the fact that in the restaurant scene, Mr White and Pink are switched, along with Brown and Pink. Sure, it's different in the movie, but that doesn't mean that the SCRIPT is wrong. That means that while making the film, Tarantino switched the characters. This is the movie how it was originally written. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. God, I love this movie.</p><hr><p><b>Blake Z</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie has one of the best scripts I have ever seen. Others can say what they want about Tarantino but I see him as an influential directer, and writer. In R-Dogs he shows his talent off again creating characters that make you laugh when you're supposed to laugh and feel suspense when you're supposed to. Not many Writers/Directors can do this, but if the movie has this effect it creates a wonderful experience for the audience to enjoy. Not to mention this flick includes actors such as Steve Buscemi and Harvey Keitel (I find it amazing Tarantino got these guys to be in hi first film!). If you are into pulp movies such as Desperado this movie will blow you away.</p><hr><p><b>Akshay</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Very good film. Thinking of other movies with a similar story and I can think of many with the same idea, a heist. But this movie had this cool idea of exploring what happens after the plan goes wrong. Stand-out idea this one. Cool dialogs too. Steve Buscemi. Where is he these days?</p><hr><p><b>Erik</b> <a href="mailto:erikboyd60@hotmail.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>I am sorry to be the only negative response on this page, but, I don't feel like everyone else that this movie was all that great. I had to watch it for a class project and I need the script, henceforth, my presence on this site. I was very bored throughout and the Mexican standoff as a climax at the end didn't do much for me. I know Tarantino is very symbolic and I saw the symbolism throughout the movie, but the vibe I got from this movie, like most Tarantino films, was that his main focus was to jam pack it with action and gore. I'm not a big fan of his for this reason. By the way, the Hannibal Lector movies were independent. Those were the best independent films ever.</p><hr><p><b>mobo</b> <img src=/images/rating/9-stars.gif> (9 out of 10 )<br>Reservoir Dogs is an excellent film. Those of you who are confused by the error in the restaurant scene with the characters appearing to be muddled should keep in mind that this is just a draft, not Tarantino's finished script.</p><hr><p><b>Butch</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>No matter what anyone thinks, Quentin Tarantino is probably the best writer, director and actor of all. His dialogs are funny, the stories are very interesting, the music is cool, and he always got the best actors. Who else gets for his first movies actors like Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen, Tim Roth, Bruce Willis, Samuel L Jackson, Pam Grier, Uma Thurman, John Travolta, Ving Rhames, Chris Penn and so many other big Legends. This guy is even acting in his own films, but he always keeps the best characters for the rest of the cast. Quentin Tarantino is a genius. Reservoir Dogs is the best heist movie ever made.</p><hr><p><b>qt_fan</b> <a href="mailto:yeahbutnobutyeahbutshutup@hotmail.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Another one of quentin tarantino's excellent screenplays. With witty dialogue and some gruesome scenes! One of tarantino's best along with pulp fiction.</p><hr><p><b>TheNakedGenius</b> <a href="mailto:thenakedgenius@btinternet.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Tarantino is a movie god. He writes about stuff no-one else would have the balls to. It's his use of pop-culture that sets him apart, plus pretty much everything else he does in his flicks. But to me the best bit is his music its beyond perfect and every song is amazing. Little Green Bag at the opening credits of R-Dogs is his best choice yet, although Misirlou at the credits of Pulp Fiction is insanely funky.</p><hr><p><b>BobTheSailor</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Quite simply and without a doubt on of the greatest films ever made in American history. The cool, crisp atmosphere mixes with the electric dialogue and interesting characters beautifully. And it's mostly filmed in Tarantino's garage. I prefer this to any other film hes made to date, Pulp fiction behind it followed by NBK. The acting was amazing on Michael Madsen, Chris Penn and Harvey Keitel's part but Tim Roth was the best in the small enough role that he had. Truly a genius film that Quentin Tarantino seems to be incapable of repeating.</p><hr><p><b>DrTandem</b> <a href="mailto:drtandem@pacbell.net" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Okay, the first time I saw the movie, I was expecting more.  However, there was something about it that made me watch it again.  I have watched it many times, now.  What I like about Tarantino's films is not the blood.  It's the time-shifting and the 60's/70's flavor he adds to them and at the same time they appear to be present day.  For instance, in Reservoir Dogs Nice Guy Eddie is using an early-model cell phone, but the rest of the movie seems to predate the invention of such a device by at least ten years.  The lines were great! Referring to the killing of "real" people versus cops and "Are you going to bark all day little doggie or are you going to bite?"</p><hr><p><b>QJT8girl</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love all of Quentin Tarantino's films. But Reservoir Dogs is his best. It's not only my favorite of his movies, it's my favorite movie of all time. I consider it to be the best movie ever made, no questions asked. Everyhing is perfect about it: the script, characters, actors, dialogue, music, the 60's/70's feel, and of course Tim Roth. I've see this movie millions of times, and listened to the soundtrack a lot. And I will never cease to watch this fantastic movie. I saw it first when I was 14 and immediately fell in love with it.</p><hr><p><b>dawn</b> <a href="mailto:i77310@yahoo.com.sg" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>My most favorite QT movie. His first remains his best and I doubt any movie he makes in future can top it. Excellent cast, I fell in love with all the Dogs- Michael madsen, steve busemi, tim roth, Harvey Keitel even QT himself (Mr. Brown) and I seriously start to watch all their films that I can get my hands on. I still watch this film every year. I love love love it.</p><hr><p><b>I love Reservoir Dogs</b> <a href="mailto:roxy3499@hotmail.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Tarantino did the best job with this movie, even if it's his first feature film he still did a magnificent job, the acting in the film was phenomenal.</p><hr><p><b>Lonny</b> <a href="mailto:temp54@hotmail.ca" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Alright can anyone tell me if that's Steven Seagal in the restaurant scene at 2:40 seconds in? He's paying the bill behind them! When he talks about Tobey. It looks like Steven.</p><hr><p><b>anonymus</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>You guys aren't thinking this through. This is the script before the movie was actually made. The roles aren't reversed, that's how Tarantino originally wrote them. Aside from that, awesome movie.</p><hr><p><b>Ernest</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>This movie is beyond racist. And Tarantino plagiarizes with most of his films. This movie is overrated.</p><hr><p><b>Cameron</b> <a href="mailto:darthsitkur@aol.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>I was really wanting to see the robbery scene but Tarantino just had to leave out the good stuff and bore us to death with the nonstop chit chat, public enemies is several times better.</p><hr><p><b>chel</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>Nice guy eddie is such a beautiful kid. I miss chris penn.</p><hr><p><b>Vince</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The reason there are some things wrong is because this is the first draft. It was written in 90 and the film came out in 92. So there's a lot of time for rewrites and changes depending on what actors got what role.</p><hr><p><b>Mike</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>The lines are not reversed, Tarantino wanted to play Mr. Pink originally before they found Steve Bucsemi.</p><hr><p><b>Carter</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is amazing, one of my favorites, and the script is just as incredible. I hope QT doesn't stop making movies any time soon, because he is one of the most gifted writers or directors ever.</p><hr><p><b>Brian</b> <a href="mailto:specfxdude@yahoo.com" title="E-mail User"><img src="/images/emailuser.gif" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/1-stars.gif> (1 out of 10 )<br>For some reason, fans of Tarantino seem to feel the need to go overboard with their praise for the garbage he puts out, as if a**kissing is going to get them a nod or an autographed 8x10 from him. I'm not afraid to say that Tarantino is nothing more than a hack and this movie is a prime example of his total lack of original storytelling. It's a total rip off of the last 30 minutes or so of a 1987 Chow Yun fat movie called City on Fire that he, no doubt, must have got his hands on and watched during his days as a video store clerk. If you watch the Yun Fat movie, you will see unmistakable imagery and shot for shot remaking Tarantino used in Dogs. Most American audiences were not even aware that City on Fire even existed back then which made it a prime target for an unknown screenwriter with dreams of being a filmmaker. Tarantino has absolutely no original visual style whatsoever and admittedly steals from every movie ever made (at least he's honest about THAT). Typically it seems he rips off whoever currently influences him. Kung fu, Blacksploitation, violent shoot-em-up flicks, nothing is safe from Tarantino's horrific attempts at film making. The only reason for his massive fame seems to be because he's a media whore and loves attention.</p><hr></td>
