</b>
<b>1      INT. UNCLE BOB'S PANCAKE HOUSE - MORNING
</b>
       Eight men dressed in BLACK SUITS, sit around a table at a
       breakfast cafe.  They are MR. WHITE, MR. PINK, MR. BLUE,
<b>       MR. BLONDE, MR. ORANGE, MR. BROWN, NICE GUY EDDIE CABOT,
</b>       and the big boss, JOE CABOT.  Most are finished eating and
       are enjoying coffee and conversation.  Joe flips through a
       small address book.  Mr. Pink is telling a long and
       involved story about Madonna.

<b>                              MR. PINK 
</b>                 "Like a Virgin" is all about a
                 girl who digs a guy with a big
                 dick.  The whole song is a
                 metaphor for big dicks.

<b>                              MR. BLUE
</b>                 No it's not.  It's about a girl
                 who is very vulnerable and she's
                 been fucked over a few times.
                 Then she meets some guy who's
                 really sensitive--

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 --Whoa...whoa...time out Greenbay.
                 Tell that bullshit to the
                 tourists.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                         (looking through his
                          address book)
                 Toby...who the fuck is Toby?
                 Toby...Toby...think...think...
                 think...

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 It's not about a nice girl who
                 meets a sensitive boy.  Now
                 granted that's what "True Blue" is
                 about, no argument about that.

<b>                              MR. ORANGE
</b>                 Which one is "True Blue?"

<b>                              NICE GUY EDDIE
</b>                 You don't remember "True Blue?"
                 That was a big ass hit for
                 Madonna.  Shit, I don't even
                 follow this Tops In Pops shit, and
                 I've at least heard of "True
                 Blue."

<b>                              MR. ORANGE
</b>                 Look, asshole, I didn't say I
                 ain't heard of it.  All I asked
                 was how does it go?  Excuse me
                 for not being the world's biggest
                 Madonna fan.

<b>                              MR. BROWN
</b>                 I hate Madonna.

<b>                              MR. BLUE
</b>                 I like her early stuff.  You know,
                 "Lucky Star," "Borderline" - but
                 once she got into her "Papa Don't
                 Preach" phase, I don't know, I
                 tuned out.

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 Hey, fuck all that, I'm
                 making a point here.  You're gonna
                 make me lose my train
                 of thought.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                 Oh fuck, Toby's that little china
                 girl.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 What's that?

<b>                              JOE
</b>                 I found this old address book in a
                 jacket I ain't worn in a coon's
                 age.  Toby what?  What the fuck
                 was her last name?

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 Where was I?

<b>                              MR. ORANGE
</b>                 You said "True Blue" was about a
                 nice girl who finds a sensitive
                 fella.  But "Like a Virgin" was a
                 metaphor for big dicks.

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 Let me tell ya what "Like a
                 Virgin"'s about.  It's about some
                 cooze who's a regular fuck
                 machine.
                 I mean all the time, morning, day,
                 night, afternoon, dick, dick,
                 dick, dick, dick,
                 dick, dick, dick, dick, dick,
                 dick.

<b>                              MR. BLUE
</b>                 How many dicks was that?

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 A lot.

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 Then one day she meets a John
                 Holmes motherfucker, and it's
                 like, whoa baby.  This mother
                 fucker's like Charles Bronson in
                 "The Great Escape."  He's diggin
                 tunnels.  Now she's gettin this
                 serious dick action, she's feelin
                 something she ain't felt since
                 forever.  Pain.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                 Chew?  Toby Chew?  No.

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 It hurts.  It hurts her.  It
                 shouldn't hurt.  Her pussy should
                 be Bubble-Yum by now.  But when
                 this cat fucks her, it hurts.  It
                 hurts like the first time.  The
                 pain is reminding a fuck machine
                 what is was like to be a virgin.
                 Hence, "Like a Virgin."

       The fellas crack up.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                 Wong?

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 Fuck you, wrong.  I'm right!  What
                 the fuck do you know about it
                 anyway?  You're still listening to
                 Jerry-fucking-Vale.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                 Not wrong, dumb ass, Wong!  You
                 know, like the Chinese name?

       Mr. White snatches the address book from Joe's hand.  They
       fight, but they're not really mad at each other.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 Give me this fucking thing.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                 What the fuck do you think you're
                 doin?  Give me my book back!

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 I'm sick of fuckin hearin it Joe,
                 I'll give it back when we leave.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                 Whaddaya mean, give it to me when
                 we leave, give it back now.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 For the past fifteen minutes now,
                 you've just been droning on with
                 names.  "Toby...Toby...Toby...
                 Toby Wong...Toby Wong...Toby
                 Chung...fuckin Charlie Chan."  I
                 got Madonna's big dick outta my
                 right ear, and Toby Jap I-don't-
                 know-what, outta my left.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                 What do you care?

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 When you're annoying as hell, I
                 care a lot.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                 Give me my book.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 You gonna put it away?

<b>                              JOE
</b>                 I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do
                 with it.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 Well, then, I'm afraid I'm gonna
                 have to keep it.

<b>                              MR. BLONDE
</b>                 Joe, you want me to shoot him for
                 you?

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you
                 better wake up and apologize.

<b>                              NICE GUY EDDIE
</b>                 Have you guys been listening to K-
                 BILLY's super sounds of the
                 seventies weekend?

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 Yeah, it's fuckin great isn't it?

<b>                              NICE GUY EDDIE
</b>                 Can you believe the songs they
                 been playin?

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 No, I can't.  You know what I
                 heard the other day?  "Heartbeat -
                 It's Lovebeat," by little Tony
                 DeFranco and the DeFranco Family.
                 I haven't heard that since I was
                 in fifth fuckin grade.

<b>                              NICE GUY EDDIE
</b>                 When I was coming down here, I was
                 playin it.  And "The Night the
                 Lights Went Out in Georgia" came
                 on.  Now I ain't heard that song
                 since it was big, but when it was
                 big, I heard it a million-
                 trillion times.  I'm listening to
                 it this morning, and this was the
                 first time I ever realized that
                 the lady singing the song, was the
                 one who killed Andy.

<b>                              MR. BLUE
</b>                 You didn't know Vicki Lawrence
                 killed the guy?

<b>                              NICE GUY EDDIE
</b>                 I thought the cheatin wife shot
                 Andy.

<b>                              MR. BLONDE
</b>                 They say it in the song.

<b>                              NICE GUY EDDIE
</b>                 I know, I heard it.  I musta zoned
                 out whenever that part came on
                 before.  I thought when she said
                 that little sister stuff, she was
                 talkin about her sister- in-law,
                 the cheatin wife.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                 No, she did it.  She killed the
                 cheatin wife, too.

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 You know the part in "Gypsies,
                 Tramps and Theives," when she says
                 "Poppa woulda shot his if he knew
                 what he'd done?"  I could never
                 figure out what he did.

       The table laughs.  The WAITRESS comes over to the table.
       She has the check, and a pot of coffee.

<b>                              WAITRESS
</b>                 Can I get anybody more
                 coffee.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                 No, we're gonna be hittin it.
                 I'll take care of the check.

       She hands the bill to him.

<b>                              WAITRESS
</b>                 Here ya go.  Please pay at the
                 register, if you wouldn't mind.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                 Sure thing.

<b>                              WAITRESS
</b>                 You guys have a wonderful day.

       They all mutter equivalents.  She exits and Joe stands up.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                 I'll take care of this, you guys
                 leave the tip.
                         (to Mr. White)
                 And when I come back, I want my
                 book back.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 Sorry, it's my book now.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                 Blonde, shoot this piece of shit,
                 will ya?

       Mr. Blonde shoots Mr. White with his finger.  Mr White
       acts shot.  Joe exits.

<b>                              NICE GUY EDDIE
</b>                Okay, everybody cough up green for
                the little lady.

       Everybody whips out a buck, and throws it on the table.
       Everybody, that is, except Mr. White.

<b>                              NICE GUY EDDIE
</b>                 C'mon, throw in a buck.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 Uh-uh.  I don't tip.

<b>                              NICE GUY EDDIE
</b>                 Whaddaya mean you don't tip?

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 I don't believe in it.

<b>                              NICE GUY EDDIE
</b>                 You don't believe in tipping?

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                         (laughing)
                 I love this kid, he's a madman,
                 this guy.

<b>                              MR. BLONDE
</b>                 Do you have any idea what these

</b>                 I don't even know a Jew who'd have
                 the balls to say that.  So let's
                 get this straight. You never ever
                 tip?

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 I don't tip because society says I
                 gotta.  I tip when somebody
                 deserves a tip.  When somebody
                 really puts forth an effort, they
                 deserve a little something extra.
                 But this tipping automatically,
                 that shit's for the birds.  As far
                 as I'm concerned, they're just
                 doin their job.

<b>                              MR. BLUE

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 Our girl was okay.  She didn't do
                 anything special.

<b>                              MR. BLONDE
</b>                 What's something special, take ya
                 in the kitchen and suck your dick?

       They all laugh.

</b>                 I'd go over twelve percent for

<b>                              MR. WRITE
</b>                 Look, I ordered coffee.  Now we've
                 been here a long fuckin time, and
                 she's only filled my cup three
                 times.  When I order coffee,  I
                 want it filled six times.

<b>                              MR. BLONDE
</b>                 What if she's too busy?

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 The words "too busy" shouldn't be
                 in a waitress's vocabulary.

<b>                              NICE GUY EDDIE
</b>                 Excuse me, Mr. White, but the last
                 thing you need is another cup of
                 coffee.

       They all laugh.

</b>                 These ladies aren't starvin to
                 death.  They make minimum wage.
                 When I worked for minimum wage, I
                 wasn't lucky enough to have a job
                 that society deemed tipworthy.

       The eight men get up to leave.  Mr. White's waist is in
       the F.G.  As he buttons his coat, for a second we see he's
       carrying a gun.  They exit Uncle Bob's Pancake House,

       Over the BLACK we hear the sound of SOMEONE SCREAMING in
       agony.

       Under the screaming, we hear the sound of a car HAULING
       ASS, through traffic.

       Over the screams and the traffic noise, we hear SOMEBODY

       The Somebody screaming is Mr. Orange.  He lies in the

       both him and the backseat.

       Mr. White is the Somebody Else.  He's behind the wheel of
       the getaway car.  He's easily doing 80 mph, dodging in and
       out of traffic.  Though he's driving for his life, he
       keeps talking to his wounded passenger in the backseat.

       They are the only two in the car.

       Mr. Orange still is MOANING loudly from his bullet hit.

       Mr. White lays him down upon a mattress on the floor.

       Mr. White gets up from over Mr. Orange and starts to prowl
       around the warehouse.

</b>                 It's not good...

<b>                              MR. ORANGE
</b>                 Hey, bless your heart for what
                 you're trying to do.  I was
                 panicking for a moment, but I've
                 got my senses back now.  The
                 situation is, I'm shot in the
                 belly.  And without medical
                 attention, I'm gonna die.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 I can' take you to a hospital.

<b>                              MR. ORANGE
</b>                 Fuck jail!  I don't give a shit
                 about jail.  But I can't die.  You
                 don't have to take me in.  Just
                 drive me up to the front, drop me
                 on the sidewalk.  I'll take care
                 of myself.  I won't tell them
                 anything.  I swear to fucking god,
                 I won't tell 'em anything.  Look
                 in my eyes, look right in my eyes.
                         (Mr. White does)
                 I-won't-tell-them-anything.
                 You'll be safe.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 Lie back down, and try to--

<b>                              MR. ORANGE
</b>                 I'm going to die!   I need a
                 doctor!  I'm begging you,
                 take me to a doctor.
<b>       
</b>       Mr. Orange lays his head back on the mattress.  Spent from
       his outburst, he quietly mutters to himself:

<b>                              MR. ORANGE
</b>                 Take me to a doctor, take me to a
                 doctor, please.

       Suddenly, the warehouse door BURSTS open and Mr.
       Pink steps inside.

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 Was that a fucking set-up or what?

       Mr. Pink sees Mr. Orange on the floor, shot and bloody.

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 Oh fuck, Orange got tagged.

       Throughout this scene, we hear Mr. Orange moaning.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 Gun shot.

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 Oh that's just fucking great!
                 Where's Brown?

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 Dead.

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 Goddamn, goddamn!  How did he die?

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 How the fuck do you think?  The
                 cops shot him.

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 Oh this is bad, this is so bad.
                         (referring to Mr.
                          Orange)
                 Is it bad?

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 As opposed to good?

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 This is so fucked up.  Somebody
                 fucked us big time.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 You really think we were set up?

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 You even doubt it?  I don't think
                 we got set up, I know we got set
                 up!  I mean really, seriously,
                 where did all those cops come
                 from, huh?  One minute they're not
                 there, the next minute
                 they're there.  I didn't hear any
                 sirens.  The alarm went off, okay.
                 Okay, when an alarm goes off, you
                 got an average of four minutes
                 response time.  Unless a patrol
                 car is cruising that street, at
                 that particular moment, you got
                 four minutes before they can
                 realistically respond.  In one
                 minute there were seventeen blue
                 boys out there.  All loaded for
                 bear, all knowing exactly what the
                 fuck they were doing, and they
                 were all just there!  Remember
                 that second wave that showed up in
                 the cars? Those were the ones
                 responding to the alarm.  but
                 those other motherfuckers were
                 already there, they were waiting
                 for us.
                         (pause)
                 You haven't thought about this?

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 I haven't had a chance to think.
                 First I was just trying to get the
                 fuck outta there.  And after we
                 got away, I've just been dealin
                 with him.

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 Well, you better start thinking
                 about it.  Cause I, sure as fuck,
                 am thinking about it.  In fact,
                 that's all I'm thinking about.  I
                 came this close to just driving
                 off.  Whoever set us up, knows
                 about this place.  There could've
                 been cops sitting here waiting for
                 me.  For all we know, there's
                 cops, driving fast, on their way
                 here now.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 Let's go in the other room...

       The camera creeps along a wall, coming to a corner.  We
       move past it, and see down a hall.

<b>5      INT. BATHROOM HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
       At the end of the hall is a bathroom.  The bathroom door
       is partially closed, restricting our view.  Mr. Pink is
       obscured, but Mr. White is in view.

<b>                              MR. PINK (OS)
</b>                 What the fuck am I doing here?  I
                 felt funny about this job right
                 off.  As soon as I felt it I
                 should said "No thank you", and
                 walked.  But I never fucking
                 listen.  Every time I ever got
                 burned buying weed, I always knew
                 the guy wasn't right.  I just felt
                 it.  But I wanted to believe him.
                 If he's not lyin to me, and it
                 really is Thai stick, then whoa
                 baby.  But it's never Thai stick.
                 and I always said if I felt that
                 way about a job, I'd walk.  And I
                 did, and I didn't, because of
                 fuckin money!

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 What's done is done, I need you
                 cool.  Are you cool?

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 I'm cool.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 Splash some water on your face.
                 Take a breather.

       We hear the sink running, and Mr. Pink splashing water on
       his face.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 I'm gonna get me my smokes.

       Mr White opens the bathroom door, walks down the hall, and
       OUT OF FRAME.  We see Mr. Pink, his back turned towards
       us, bent over the sink.  Then he grabs a towels, and dries
       his face.  Mr White ENTERS FRAME with a pack of
       Chesterfields in his hand.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 Want a smoke?

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 Why not?

       The two men light up.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 Okay, let's go through what
                 happened.  We're in the place,
                 everything's going fine.  Then the
                 alarm gets tripped.  I turn around
                 and all these cops are outside.
                 You're right, it was like, bam!  I
                 blink my eyes are they're there.
                 Everybody starts going apeshit.
                 Then Mr. Blonde starts shootin all
                 the--

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 --That's not correct.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 What's wrong with it?

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 The cops didn't show up after the
                 alarm went off.  They didn't show
                 till after Mr. Blonde started
                 shooting everyone.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 As soon as I heard the alarm, I
                 saw the cops.

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 I'm telling ya, it wasn't that
                 soon.  They didn't let their
                 presence be known until after Mr.
                 Blonde went off.  I'm not sayin
                 they weren't there, I'm sayin they
                 were there.  But they didn't move
                 in till Mr. Blonde became a
                 madman.  That's how I know we were
                 set up.  You can see that,
                 can't you, Mr. White?

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 Look, enough of this "Mr White"
                 shit--

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 --Don't tell me your name, I don't
                 want to know!  I sure as hell
                 ain't gonna tell ya
                 mine.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 You're right, this is bad.
                         (pause)
                 How did you get out?

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 Shot my way out.  Everybody was
                 shooting, so I just blasted my way
                 outta there.

</b>

<b>6      EXT. CROWDED CITY STREET - DAY
</b>
       Mr. Pink is hauling ass down a busy city sidewalk.  He has
       a canvas bag with a shoulder strap in one hand, and a .357
       MAGNUM in the other.  If any BYSTANDERS get in his way, he
       just knocks them down.  We DOLLY at the same speed, right
       along side of him.

       FOUR POLICEMEN are running after Mr. Pink.  We DOLLY with
       them.

       We DOLLY with a young woman on roller skates.  ROLLERGIRL
       is plugged into a walkman.  We hear the song she's
       listening to LOUD over the SOUNDTRACK.  She's twirling and
       skating backwards to the beat of the song.

       Rollergirl turns a corner and COLLIDES with Mr. Pink.  The
       man and woman CRASH to the ground.

       Mr. Pink rolls into the street, in front of a moving car
       that SCREECHES to a stop, narrowly avoiding running over
       him.


<b>7      INT. CAR (STOPPED) - DAY
</b>
       The CAMERA is in the backseat. A SHOCKED WOMAN is the
       car's driver.  Mr. Pink pulls himself up from the hood,
       shakes it off, and points his magnum at the driver.

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 Get outta the car!  Get the fuck

       The Shocked Woman starts screaming.

       Mr. Pink tries to open the driver's side door, but it's
       locked.

<b>                              MR. PINK

       DOLLY with Cops coming up fast.

       Mr. Pink DRAGS the Shocked Woman out of the car.

       The Cops reach the corner, guns aimed.

       Using the car as a shield, Mr. Pink FIRES three shots at
       the Cops.

       Everybody HITS the ground, or scatters.

       Mr. Pink HOPS in the car.

       Cops FIRE.

<b>                              MR. WHITE

                 somebody like that?

<b>                              MR. PINK

<b>                              MR. WHITE

                 Everybody.  I don't care what your
                 name is, you can't help it.  It's
                 human nature.  But ya panic on the
                 inside.
                 Ya panic in your head.  Ya give
                 yourself a couple a seconds of
                 panic, then you get a grip and
                 deal with the situation.  What you
                 don't do, is shoot up the place
                 and kill everybody.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 What you're supposed to do is act
                 like a fuckin professional.  A
                 psychopath is not a professional.
                 You can't work with a psychopath,
                 'cause ya don't know what those
                 sick assholes are gonna do next.
                 I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do
                 you think that black girl was?
                 Twenty, maybe twenty-one?

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 Did ya see what happened to
                 anybody else?

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the
                 car and Mr. Brown floored it.
                 After that, I don't know what went
                 down.

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 At that point it became every man
                 for himself.  As far as Mr. Blonde
                 or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't
                 got the foggiest.  Once
                 I got out, I never looked back.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 What do you think?

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 What do I think?  I think the cops
                 caught them, or killed 'em.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 Not even a chance they punched
                 through?  You found a hole.

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 Yeah, and that was a fucking
                 miracle.  But if they did get
                 away, where the fuck are they?

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 You don't think it's possible, one
                 of them got ahold of the diamonds
                 and pulled a--

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 Nope.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 How can you be so sure?

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 I got the diamonds.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 Where?

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 I got 'em, all right?

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 Where?  Are they out in the car?

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 No, they're not in the car.  No, I
                 don't have them on me.  Ya wanna
                 go with me and get 'em?  Yes, we
                 can go right now.  But first
                 listen to what I'm telling you.
                 We were fuckin set up!  Somebody
                 is in league with the cops.  We
                 got a Judas in our midst.  And I'm
                 thinkin we should have our fuckin
                 heads examined for waiting around
                 here.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 That was the plan, we meet here.

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 Then where is everybody?  I say
                 the plan became null and void once
                 we found out we got a rat in the
                 house.  We ain't got the slightest
                 fuckin idea what happened to Mr.
                 Blonde or Mr. Blue.  They could
                 both be dead
                 or arrested.  They could be
                 sweatin 'em, down at the station
                 house right now.  Yeah they don't
                 know the names, but they can sing
                 about this place.
                 I mean, that could be happening
                 right now.  As we speak, the cops
                 could be in their cars, drivin
                 here this minute.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 I swear to god I'm fuckin jinxed.

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 What?

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 Two jobs back, it was a four man
                 job, we discovered one of the team
                 was an undercover cop.

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 No shit?

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 Thank god, we discovered in time.
                 We hadda forget the whole fuckin
                 thing.  Just walked away from it.

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 So who's the rat this time?  Mr.
                 Blue?  Mr. Blonde?  Joe?  It's
                 Joe's show, he set this whole
                 thing up.  Maybe he set it up to
                 set it up.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 I don't buy it.  Me and Joe go
                 back a long time.  I can tell ya
                 straight up, Joe definitely didn't
                 have anything to do with this
                 bullshit.

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 Oh, you and Joe go back a long
                 time.  I known Joe since I was a
                 kid.  But me saying Joe definitely
                 couldn't have done it is
                 ridiculous.  I can say I
                 definitely didn't do it, cause I
                 know what I did or didn't do.  But
                 I can't definitely say that about
                 anybody else, 'cause I don't
                 definitely know.  For all I know,
                 you're the rat.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 For all I know, you're the rat.

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 Now you're using your head. For
                 all we know, he's the rat.

       Mr. Pink points OFFSCREEN to Mr. Orange.  Mr. White's
       expression changes.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 Jesus Christ!


<b>11     INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY
</b>
       They run over to Mr. Orange, who's unconscious.  The
       CAMERA hovers over the action.  Mr. Pink reaches him
       first.

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 Is he dead?

       Mr. White pushes him out of the way.  He feels the pulse
       on Mr. Orange's neck.

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 So, is he dead or what?

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 He ain't dead.

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 So what is it?

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 I think he's just passed out.

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 He scared the fuckin shit outta
                 me.  I thought he was dead fer
                 sure.

       Mr. White stands up and walks over to a table.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 He will be dead fer sure, if we
                 don't get him to a hospital.

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 We can't take him to a hospital.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 Without medical attention, this
                 man won't live through the night.
                 That bullet in his belly is my
                 fault.  Now while that might not
                 mean jack shit to you, it means a
                 helluva lot to me.  And I'm not
                 gonna just sit around and watch
                 him die.

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 Well, first things first, staying
                 here's goofy.  We gotta book up.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 So what do you suggest, we go to a
                 hotel?  We got a guy who's shot in
                 the belly, he can't walk, he
                 bleeds like a stuck pig, and when
                 he's awake, he screams in pain.

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 You gotta idea, spit it out.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 Joe could help him.  If we can get
                 in touch with Joe, Joe could get
                 him to a doctor, Joe could get a
                 doctor to come and see him.

       During Mr. Pink's dialog, we slowly ZOOM in to a 
       C.U. of Mr. White.

<b>                              MR. PINK (OS)
</b>                 Assuming we can trust Joe, how we
                 gonna get in touch with him?  He's
                 supposed to be here, but he ain't,
                 which is making me nervous about
                 being here.  Even if Joe is
                 on the up and up, he's probably
                 not gonna be that happy with us.
                 Joe planned a robbery, but he's
                 got a blood bath on his hands now.
                 Dead cops, dead robbers, dead
                 civilians...Jesus Christ!  I tend
                 to doubt he's gonna have a lot of
                 sympathy for our plight.  If I was
                 him, I'd try and put as much
                 distance between me and this mess
                 an humanly possible.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 Before you got here, Mr. Orange
                 was askin me to take him to a
                 hospital.  Now I don't like
                 turning him over to the cops, but
                 if we don't, he's dead.  He begged
                 me to do it.  I told him to hold
                 off till Joe got here.

<b>                              MR. PINK (OS)
</b>                 Well Joe ain't gettin here.  We're
                 on our own.  Now, I don't know a
                 goddamn body who can help him, so
                 if you know somebody, call 'em.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 I don't know anybody.

<b>                              MR. PINK (OS)
</b>                 Well, I guess we drop him off at
                 the hospital.  Since he don't know
                 nothin about us, I say it's his
                 decision.


<b>       MR. WHITE'S POV:

<b>                              MR. WHITE (OS)
</b>                 Well, he knows a little about me.

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 You didn't tell him your name, did

<b>                              MR. WHITE (OS)
</b>                 I told him my first name, and
                 where I'm from.

       There is a long silence and a blank look from Mr. Pink,
       then he SCREAMS:

</b>                 Why!

<b>                              MR. WHITE (OS)
</b>                 I told him where I was from a few
                 days ago.  It was just a casual
                 conversation.

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 And what was tellin him your name

<b>                              MR. WHITE (OS)
</b>                 He asked.

       Mr. Pink looks at Mr. White like he's retarded.

<b>                              MR. WHITE (OS)
</b>                 We had just gotten away from the

                 my fuckin fault he got shot.  He's
                 a fuckin bloody mess - he's
                 screaming.  I swear to god, I
                 thought we was gonna die right
                 then and there.  I'm tryin to
                 comfort him, telling him not to
                 worry, he's gonna be okay, I'm
                 gonna take care of him.  And he
                 asked me what my name was.  I
                 mean, the man was dyin in my arms.
                 What the fuck was I supposed to
                 tell him, "Sorry, I can't give out

                 rules.  I don't trust you

                 helluva lot of pictures for him to
                 pick you out.  That's it right,
                 you didn't tell him anything else
                 that could narrow down the
                 selection?

<b>                              MR. WHITE (OS)

                 round and round.

       Mr. Pink walks out of the C.U. and turns his back on Mr.
       White.  Mr. White's POV PANS over to him.

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 We ain't taking him to a hospital.

</b>                 If we don't, he'll die.

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 And I'm very sad about that.  But
                 some fellas are lucky, and some
                 ain't.

<b>                              MR. WHITE (OS)
</b>                 That fuckin did it!

       Mr. White's POV CHARGES toward Mr. Pink.

       Mr. Pink turns toward him in time to get PUNCHED hard in
       the mouth.

<b>       END OF POV
</b>
       Mr. White and Mr. Pink have a very ungraceful and
       realistic fight.  They go at each other like a couple of
       alley cats.

       As Mr. White SWINGS and PUNCHES, he SCREAMS:

<b>                               MR. WHITE
</b>
                 You little motherfucker!

       Mr. Pink YELLS as he HITS:

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 Ya wanna fuck with me?!  You wanna
                 fuck with me?!  I'll show you who
                 you're fuckin with!

       The two men end up on the floor KICKING and SCRATCHING.

       Mr. White gets Mr. Pink in a HEADLOCK.

       Mr. Pink reaches in his jacket for his gun, and pulls it
       out.

       Mr. White sees this, immediately lets go of Mr. Pink,
       and goes for his own weapon.

       The two men are on the floor, on their knees, with their
       guns outstretched, aiming at one another.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 You wanna shoot me, you little
                 piece of shit?  Take a shot!

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 Fuck you, White!  I didn't create
                 this situation,  I'm just dealin
                 with it.  You're acting like a
                 first-year fuckin thief.  I'm
                 actin like a professional.  They
                 get him, they can get you, they
                 get you, they get closer to me,
                 and that can't happen.  And you,
                 you motherfucker, are looking at
                 me like it's my fault.  I didn't
                 tell him my name.  I didn't tell
                 him where I was from.  I didn't
                 tell him what I knew better than
                 to tell him.  Fuck, fifteen
                 minutes ago, you almost told me
                 your name.  You, buddy, are stuck
                 in a situation you created.  So if
                 you wanna throw bad looks
                 somewhere, throw 'em at a mirror.

       Mr. Pink lowers his gun and walks towards White.

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 So if you wanna shoot somebody,
                 put that gun in your mouth and
                 shoot yourself.

       Then from OFF SCREEN we hear:

<b>                              VOICE (OS)
</b>                 You kids don't play so rough.
                 Somebody's gonna start crying.


<b>12     INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY - MEDIUM C.U. ON MR. BLONDE
</b>
       The Voice belongs to the infamous Mr. Blonde.

       Mr. Blonde sits on a counter, drinking a fast food coke
       and eating a hot dog.

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 Mr. Blonde!  You okay?  We thought
                 you might've gotten caught.  What
                 happened?

       Mr. Blonde doesn't answer, he just hops off the counter
       and starts walking around the warehouse, checking the
       place out.

       He doesn't look at either Mr. Pink or Mr. White, he
       just eats his hot dog and sips his coke.

       This is making Pink and White nervous as hell.  But Mr.
       Pink tries to talk through it.

       We HANDHOLD follow Mr. Blonde around the warehouse.

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 Really, how did you get away?

       Mr. Blonde walks the loft.  Silent.

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 You saw what happened to me,
                 I found a hole and booked.

       Silence.

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 Where's Mr. Blue?

       Blonde looks in the bathroom.

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 We were hopin you two would be
                 together.

       Blonde looks out the window.

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 That was the big question we had,
                 what happened to Mr.
                 Blue and you?

       Blonde walks away from the window.

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 We were worried the cops got ya.

       Blonde bends down over Mr. Orange.

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 He got it in the belly.  He's
                 still alive, but won't be for
                 long.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 Enough!  You better start talkin
                 to us, asshole, cause we got shit
                 we need to talk about.  We're
                 already freaked out, we need you
                 actin freaky like we need a fuckin
                 bag on our hip.

       Mr. Blonde looks at his two partners in crime, then moves
       towards them.

<b>                              MR. BLONDE
</b>                 So, talk.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 We think we got a rat in the
                 house.

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 I guarantee we got a rat in the
                 house.

<b>                              MR. BLONDE
</b>                 What would ever make you think
                 that?

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 Is that supposed to be funny?

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 We don't think this place is safe.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 This place just ain't secure
                 anymore.  We're leaving, and you
                 should go with us.

<b>                              MR. BLONDE
</b>                 Nobody's going anywhere.

       Silence takes over the room.  Mr. Blonde stops moving.

       After a few beats the silence is broken.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                         (to Mr. Pink)
                 Piss on this turd, we're outta
                 here.

       Mr. White turns to leave.

<b>                              MR. BLONDE
</b>                 Don't take another step, Mr.
                 White.

       Mr. White explodes, raising his gun and charging towards
       Mr. Blonde.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 Fuck you, maniac!  It's your
                 fuckin fault we're in so much
                 trouble.

       Mr. Blonde calmly sits down.  He looks to Mr. Pink.

<b>                              MR. WHITE

                 Right now, Mr. Blonde is the only
                 one I completely trust.  He's too
                 fuckin homicidal to be workin with

                 who's the bad guy.

       Mr. White calms down and puts his gun away.

       Mr. Blonde returns to the persona we saw at the beginning,
       talking about Madonna.

<b>                              MR. BLONDE

       Mr. Blonde hops out of his chair and heads for the door.

       The other two men just follow him with their eyes.

<b>13     EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

       Three cars are parked out front.  Mr. Blonde is walking

<b>14     INT. JOE CABOT'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
       We're inside the office of Joe Cabot.  Joe's on the phone,
       sitting behind his desk.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                         (into phone)
                 Sid, I'm tellin you don't worry
                 about it.  You had a bad couple of
                 months, it happens.
                         (pause)
                 Sid, Sid, Sid...Stop, you're
                 embarrassing me.  I don't need to
                 be told what I already know.  When
                 you have bad months, you do what
                 every business man in the
                 worlds does, I don't care if he's
                 Donald Trump or Irving the tailor.
                 Ya ride it out.

       There's a KNOCK on Cabot's office door.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                 Come in.

       One of Cabot's goons, TEDDY, opens the door and steps
       inside.  Cabot covers the receiver with his hand and looks
       towards the man.

<b>                              TEDDY
</b>                 Vic Vega's outside.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                 Tell him to come in.

       Teddy leaves.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                         (into phone)
                 Sid, a friend of mine's here.  I
                 gotta go.
                         (pause)
                 Good enough, bye.

       He hangs up the phone, stands, and walks around to the
       front of the desk.

       Teddy opens the office door, and TOOTHPICK VIC VEGA walks
       in.

       Toothpick Vic Vega is none other than our very own Mr.
       Blonde.  Vic is dressed in a long black leather seventies
       style jacket.

       Joe stands in front of his desk with his arms open.

       The two men embrace each other.  Teddy leaves, closing the
       door behind him.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                 How's freedom kid, pretty fuckin
                 good, ain't it?

<b>                              VIC
</b>                 It's a change.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                 Ain't that a sad truth.  Remy
                 Martin?

<b>                              VIC
</b>                 Sure.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                 Take a seat.

       Joe goes over to his liquor cabinet.  Vic sits in a chair
       set in front of Joe's desk.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                         (while he pours the
                          drink)
                 Who's your parole officer?

<b>                              VIC
</b>                 A guy named Koons.  Craig Koons.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                 How is he?

<b>                              VIC
</b>                 Fuckin asshole, won't let me leave
                 the halfway house.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                 Never ceases to amaze me.  Fuckin
                 jungle bunny goes out there, slits
                 some old woman's throat for
                 twenty-five cents.  Fuckin nigger
                 gets Doris Day as a parole
                 officer.  But a good fella like
                 you gets stuck with a ball-bustin
                 prick.

       Joe walks back around his desk and sits in his chair.

       Vic swallows some Remy.

<b>                              VIC
</b>                 I just want you to know, Joe, how
                 much I appreciate your care
                 packages on the inside.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                 What the hell did you expect me to
                 do?  Just forget about you?

<b>                              VIC
</b>                 I just wanted you to know, they
                 meant a lot.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                 It's the least I could do Vic.  I
                 wish I coulda done more.
                         (Joe flashes a side
                          grin at Vic)
                 Vic. Toothpick Vic.  Tell me a
                 story?  What're your plans?

<b>                              VIC
</b>                 Well, what I wanna do is go back
                 to work.  But I got this Koons
                 prick deep up my ass.  He won't
                 let me leave the halfway house
                 till I get some piece of shit job.
                 My plans have always been to be
                 part of the team again.

       There's a KNOCK at the door.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                 Come in.

       The door opens and in walks Joe's son, Nice Guy Eddie.
       Vic turns around in his seat and sees him.

<b>                              EDDIE
</b>                         (to Vic)
                 I see ya sittin here, but I don't
                 believe it.

       Vic gets out of his seat and hugs Eddie.

<b>                              EDDIE
</b>                 How ya doin, Toothpick?

<b>                              VIC
</b>                 Fine, now.

<b>                              EDDIE
</b>                 I'm sorry man, I shoulda picked
                 you up personally at the pen.
                 This whole week's just been crazy.
                 I've had my head up my ass the
                 entire time.

<b>                              VIC
</b>                 Funny you should mention it.
                 That's what your father and I been
                 talkin about.

<b>                              EDDIE
</b>                 That I should've picked you up?

<b>                              VIC
</b>                 No.  That your head's been up your
                 ass.  I walk through the door and
                 Joe says "Vic, you're back, thank
                 god.  Finally somebody who knows
                 what the fuck he's doing.  Vic,
                 Vic, Vic, Eddie, my son, is a fuck
                 up."  And I say "Well, Joe, I
                 coulda told you that."  "I'm
                 ruined!  He's ruining me!  My son,
                 I love him, but he's taking my
                 business and flushing it down the
                 fuckin toilet!"
                         (to Joe)
                 I'm not tellin tales out of
                 school.  You tell 'im Joe.
                 Tell 'im yourself.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                 Eddie, I hate like hell for you to
                 hear it this way.  But when Vic
                 asked me how's business, well, you
                 don't lie to a man who's just done
                 four years in the slammer for ya.

       Eddie bobs his head up and down.

<b>                              EDDIE
</b>                  Oh really, is that a fact?

       Eddie JUMPS Vic and they fall to the floor.

       The two friends, laughing and cussing at each other,
       wrestle on the floor of Joe's office.

       Joe's on his feet yelling at them.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                         (yelling)
                 Okay, okay, enough, enough!
                 Playtime's over!  You wanna roll
                 around on the floor, do it in
                 Eddie's office, not mine!

       The two men break it up.  They are completely disheveled,
       hair a mess, shirttails out.  As they get themselves
       together, they continue to taunt one another.

<b>                              EDDIE
</b>                 Daddy, did ya see that?

<b>                              JOE
</b>                 What?

<b>                              EDDIE
</b>                 Guy got me on the ground, tried to
                 fuck me.

<b>                              VIC
</b>                 You fuckin wish.

<b>                              EDDIE
</b>                 You tried to fuck me in my
                 father's office, you sick bastard.
                 Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do
                 in the privacy of your own home,
                 go do it.  But don't try to fuck
                 me.  I don't think of you that
                 way.  I mean, I like you a lot--

<b>                              VIC
</b>                 Eddie, if I was a pirate, I
                 wouldn't throw you to the crew.

<b>                              EDDIE
</b>                 No, you'd keep me for yourself.
                 Four years fuckin punks in the ass
                 made you appreciate prime rib when
                 you get it.

<b>                              VIC
</b>                 I might break you, Nice Guy, but
                 I'd make you my dog's bitch.
                 You'd be suckin the dick and going
                 down on a mangy T-bone hound.

<b>                              EDDIE
</b>                 Now ain't that a sad sight, daddy,
                 walks into jail a white man, walks
                 out talkin like a nigger.  It's
                 all that black semen been shootin
                 up his butt.  It's backed up into
                 his brain and comes out of his
                 mouth.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                 Are you two finished?  We were
                 talkin about some serious shit
                 when you came in Eddie.  We got a
                 big problem we're tryin to solve.
                 Now Eddie, would you like to sit
                 down and help us solve it, or do
                 you two wanna piss fart around?

       Playtime is over and Vic and Eddie know it.  So they both
       take seats in front of Joe's desk.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                 Now Vic was tellin me, he's got a
                 parole problem.

<b>                              EDDIE
</b>                 Really?  Who's your P.O.?

<b>                              VIC
</b>                 Craig Koons.

<b>                              EDDIE
</b>                 Koons?  Oh shit, I hear he's a
                 motherfucker.

<b>                              VIC
</b>                 He is a motherfucker.  He won't
                 let me leave the halfway house
                 till I get some piece of shit job.

<b>                              EDDIE
</b>                 You're coming back to work for us,
                 right?

<b>                              VIC
</b>                 I wanna.  But I gotta show this
                 asshole I got an honest-to-
                 goodness job before he'll let me
                 move out on my own.  I can't work
                 for you guys and be worried about
                 gettin back before ten o'clock
                 curfew.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                         (to Eddie)
                 We can work this out, can't we?

<b>                              EDDIE
</b>                 This isn't all that bad.  We can
                 give you a lot of legitimate jobs.
                 Put you on the rotation at Long
                 Beach as a dock worker.

<b>                              VIC
</b>                 I don't wanna lift crates.

<b>                              EDDIE
</b>                 You don't hafta lift shit.  You
                 don't really work there.  But as
                 far as the records are concerned,
                 you do.  I call up Matthews, the
                 foreman, tell him he's got a new
                 guy.  You're on the schedule.  You
                 got a timecard, it's clocked in
                 and out for you everyday, and you
                 get a pay check at the end of the
                 week.  And ya know dock workers
                 don't do too bad.  So you can move
                 into a halfway decent place
                 without Koons thinkin "what the
                 fuck."  And if Koons ever wants to
                 make a surprise visit, you're gone
                 that day.  That day we sent you to
                 Tustin.  We gotta bunch of shit
                 you needed to unload there.
                 You're at the Taft airstrip pickin
                 up a bunch of shit and bringing it
                 back.  Part of your jab is goin
                 different places - and we got
                 places all over the place.

<b>                              JOE

                 Didn't I tell ya not to worry?
                         (to Eddie)
                 Vic was worried.

<b>                              EDDIE
</b>                 Me and you'll drive down to Long
                 Beach tomorrow.  I'll introduce
                 you to Matthews, tell him what's
                 going on.

<b>                              VIC

                 When do you think you'll need me
                 for real work?

<b>                              JOE
</b>                 Well, it's kinda a strange time
                 right now.  Things are kinda--

<b>                              EDDIE
</b>                 --Nuts.  We got a big meeting in

                 we'll be talking to ya.

<b>                              EDDIE
</b>                 Daddy, I got an idea.  Now just
                 hear it out.  I know you don't
                 like to use any of the boys on
                 these jobs, but technically, Vic
                 ain't one of the boys.  He's been
                 gone for four years.  He ain't on
                 no one's list.  Ya know he can
                 handle himself, ya know you can
                 trust him.

       Joe looks at Vic.

       Vic has no idea what they're talking about.

<b>                              JOE

<b>                              VIC

<b>                              JOE
</b>                 Two minutes, tops.  It's a tough
                 two minutes.  It's a hold up,
                 daylight, during business hours,
                 dealing with a crowd.  But you
                 have the fellas to deal with the
                 crowd.  It's a jewelry store.
                 They're getting a big shipment of
                 South African diamonds on a
                 certain day.  They're like a way
                 station.  It's gonna get picked up
                 the next day and sent to Hamburg.
                 When you walk through the door,
                 you'll know right where to go for
                 the rich stones.
                 The fellas are good, me and Nice
                 Guy picked em.  Nobody knows
                 anybody else.  Nobody's connected.
                 I don't use connected guys for
                 this shit.

<b>                              VIC
</b>                 What's the cut?

<b>                              JOE

                 He said the place turned into a
                 fuckin bullet festival.  He took a

                         (Eddie takes charge)
                 Look, this is the news.  Blondie,
                 you stay here and take care of
                 them two.  White and Pink come
                 with me, 'cuz if Joe gets here and
                 sees all those fucking cars
                 parked out front, he's going to be
                 as mad at me as he is at you.

       Eddie, Mr. White and Mr. Pink walk out of the warehouse
       talking amongst themselves.


<b>22     INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY - MR. BLONDE AND COP

       Mr. Blonde closes the door after them.  He then slowly
       turns his head towards the cop.

<b>                              MR. BLONDE
</b>                 Alone at last.

<b>                              COP
</b>                 I told you I don't know anything

                 only been on the force eight
                 months, nobody tells me anything!
                 I don't know anything!  You can
                 torture me if you want--

</b>                 Your boss even said there wasn't a

</b>                 First off, I don't have a boss.
                 Are you clear about that?

       He SLAPS the cop's face.

<b>                              MR. BLONDE (OS)
</b>                 I asked you a question.  Are you

                 torture you for awhile regardless.
                 Not to get information, but
                 because torturing a cop amuses me.
                 There's nothing you can say,
                 there's nothing you can do.
                 Except pray for death.

       He puts a piece of tape over the cop's mouth.


<b>       COP'S POV
</b>
       Mr. Blonde walks away from the cop.

<b>                              MR. BLONDE
</b>                 Let's see what's on K-BILLY'S
                 "super sounds of the seventies"
                 weekend.

       He turns on the radio.

       Stealer's Wheel's hit "Stuck in the Middle with You" PLAYS
       over the speaker.

       NOTE: This entire sequence is timed to the music.

       Mr. Blonde slowly walks toward the cop.

       He opens a large knife.

       He grabs a chair, places it in front of the cop and sits
       in it.

       Mr. Blonde just stares into the cop's/our face, holding
       the knife, singing along with the song.

       Then, like a cobra, he LASHES out.

       A SLASH across the face.

       The cop/camera moves around wildly.

       Mr. Blonde just stares into the cop's/our face, singing
       along with the seventies hit.

       Then he reaches out and CUTS OFF the cop's/our ear.

       The cop/camera moves around wildly.

       Mr. Blonde holds the ear up to the cop/us to see.

       Mr. Blonde rises, kicking the chair he was sitting on out
       of the way.


<b>23     INT./EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY - HANDHELD SHOT
</b>
       We follow Mr Blonde as he walks out of the warehouse...

       ...to his car.  He opens the trunk, pulls out a large can
       of gasoline.

       He walks back inside the warehouse...


<b>24     INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY
</b>
       ...carrying the can of gas.

       Mr. Blonde POURS the gasoline all over the cop, who's
       BEGGING him not to do this.

       Mr. Blonde just sings along with Stealer's Wheel.

       Mr. Blonde LIGHTS up a match and, while mouthing:

<b>                              MR. BLONDE
</b>                 "Clowns to the left of me,
                 Jokers to the right.  Here I am,
                 stuck in the middle with you."

       He moves the match up to the cop...

       ...When a bullet EXPLODES in Mr. Blonde's chest.

       The HANDHELD camera WHIPS to the right and we see the
       bloody Mr. Orange FIRING his gun.

       We cut back and forth between Mr. Blonde taking BULLET
       HITS and Mr. Orange emptying his weapon.

       Mr. Blonde FALLS down dead.

       Mr. Orange crawls to where the cop is, leaving a bloody
       trail behind him.

       When he reaches the cop's feet he looks up at him.

                         (pause)
                 How do I look?

       The gun-shot Mr. Orange looks at the kid's GASHED face and
       the hole in the side of his head where his ear used to be.

<b>                              MR. ORANGE

       Jeffrey starts to weep.

<b>25     INT.  DENNY'S - NIGHT
</b>
       A tough-looking black man named HOLDAWAY, who sports a
       Malcom X beard, a green Chairman Mao cap with a red star
       on it, and a military flack jacket, digs into a Denny
       bacon, cheese and avocado burger.  He sits in a booth all
       alone.  He's waiting for somebody.  As he waits, he
       practically empties an entire bottle of ketchup on his
       french fries, not by mistake either--that's just how he
       likes it.

       We see Mr. Orange, now known as FREDDY NEWENDYKE, wearing
       a high school letterman jacket, enter the coffee shop,
       spot Holdaway, and head his way.  Holdaway sees Freddy bop
       towards him with a wide-ass alligator grin plastered
       across his face.

       CAMERA DOLLIES FAST down AISLE to MEDIUM SHOT of Holdaway.
       We fear Freddy OFF SCREEN.

<b>                              FREDDY (O.S.)
</b>                 Say "hello" to a motherfucker
                 who's inside.  Cabot's doing a job
                 and take a big fat guess who he
                 wants on the team?

<b>                              HOLDAWAY

                 I'm up his ass.

<b>       CU ON HOLDAWAY
</b>
       Holdaway just looks at his pupil for a moment, then
       smiles.

<b>                              HOLDAWAY

<b>26     EXT.  DENNY'S - NIGHT
</b>
       We see through the window of the restaurant Freddy slide
       into the booth across from Holdaway.  Freddy's doing a lot
       of talking, but we can't hear what they're saying.


<b>27     INT.  DENNY'S - NIGHT
</b>
<b>       FREEZE FRAME ON HOLDAWAY
</b>
       We are frozen on a MEDIUM CU of Holdaway listening to
       Freddy.  We HEAR RESTAURANT NOISE and Freddy OFF SCREEN.

<b>                              FREDDY (O.S.)
</b>                 Nice Guy Eddie tells me Joe wants
                 to meet me.  He says I should just
                 hang around my apartment and wait
                 for a phone call.  Well after
                 waiting three goddamn days by the
                 fuckin phone, he calls me last
                 night and says Joe's ready, and
                 he'll pick me up in fifteen
                 minutes.

       The freeze frame ENDS.  Holdaway comes suddenly up to
       speed and says:

<b>                              HOLDAWAY
</b>                 Woo all picked you up?

       From here to end we cut back and forth.

<b>                              FREDDY
</b>                 Nice Guy.  When we got to the

<b>                              HOLDAWAY
</b>                 ...What bar?

<b>                              FREDDY
</b>                 The Boots and Socks in Gardena.
                 When we got there, I met Joe and a
                 guy named Mr. White.  It's a phony
                 name.  My name's Mr. Orange.

<b>                              HOLDAWAY
</b>                 You ever seen this motherfucker

<b>                              FREDDY

<b>                              HOLDAWAY
</b>                 Yeah.

<b>                              FREDDY
</b>                 No, he ain't familiar.  He ain't
                 one of Cabot's soldiers either.
                 He's gotta be from outta town.
                 But Joe knows him real well.

<b>                              HOLDAWAY
</b>                 How can you tell?

<b>                              FREDDY
</b>                 The way they talk to each other.
                 You can tell they're buddies.

<b>                              HOLDAWAY
</b>                 Did the two of you talk?

<b>                              FREDDY

<b>                              FREDDY
</b>                 A little.

<b>                              HOLDAWAY
</b>                 What about?

<b>                              FREDDY
</b>                 The Brewers.

<b>                              HOLDAWAY
</b>                 The Milwaukee Brewers?

<b>                              FREDDY
</b>                 Yeah.  They had just won the night
                 before, and he made a killing off
                 'em.

<b>                              HOLDAWAY
</b>                 Well, if this crook's a Brewers
                 fan, his ass has gotta be from
                 Wisconsin.  And I'll bet you
                 everything from a diddle-eyed Joe
                 to a damned-if-I-know, that in
                 Milwaukee they got a sheet on this
                 Mr. White motherfucker's ass.  I
                 want you to go through the mugs of
                 guys from old Milwaukee with a
                 history of armed robbery, and put
                 a name to that face.

       Holdaway takes a big bite out of his burger.

                 What kinds questions did Cabot
                 ask?

<b>                              FREDDY
</b>                 Where I was from, who I knew, how
                 I knew Nice Guy, had I done time,
                 shit like that.

       Holdaway's talked enough, he's eating his burger now.  He
       motions for Freddy to elaborate.

<b>                              FREDDY
</b>                 He asked me if I ever done armed
                 robbery before.  I read him my
                 credits.  I robbed a few gas and
                 sips, sold some weed, told him
                 recently I held the shotgun while
                 me and another guy pulled down a
                 poker game in Portland.

                 Marlon Brando.  To do this job you
                 got to be a great actor.  You got
                 to be naturalistic.  You got to be
                 naturalistic as hell.  If you
                 ain't a great actor you're a bad
                 actor, and bad acting is bull shit
                 in this job.

<b>                              HOLDAWAY
</b>                 It's like a joke.  You remember

                 make your own.  The only way to

                 story takes place in this men's
                 room.  So you gotta know the
                 details about this men's room.
                 You gotta know they got a blower
                 instead of a towel to dry your
                 hands.  You gotta know the stalls
                 ain't got no doors.  You gotta
                 know whether they got liquid or
                 powdered soap, whether they got
                 hot water or not, 'cause if you do
                 your job when you tell your story,
                 everybody should believe it.  And
                 if you tell your story to somebody
                 who's actually taken a piss in
                 this men's room, and you get one
                 detail they remember right,
                 they'll swear by you.


<b>29     INT.  FREDDY'S APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
       Freddy paces back and forth, in and out of frame,
       rehearsing the anecdote.  He's reading it pretty good, but
       he's still reading it from the page, and every once in a
       while he stumbles over his words.

<b>                              FREDDY
</b>                 ...this was during the Los Angeles
                 marijuana drought of '86.  I still
                 had a connection.  Which was
                 insane, 'cause you couldn't get
                 weed anyfuckinwhere then.  Anyway,
                 I had a connection with this
                 hippie chick up in Santa Cruz.
                 All and my friends knew it.  And
                 they'd give me a call and say,
                 "Hey, Freddy, you buyin some, you
                 think you could buy me some too?"
                 They knew I smoked, so they'd ask
                 me to buy a little for them when I
                 was buyin.  But it got to be
                 everytime I bought some weed, I
                 was buyin for four or five
                 different people.  Finally I said,
                 "Fuck this shit."  I'm makin this
                 bitch rich.  She didn't have to do
                 jack shit, she never even had to
                 meet these people.  I was fuckin
                 doin all the work.  So I got
                 together with her and told her,
                 "Hey, I'm sick of this shit.  I'm
                 comin through for everybody, and
                 nobody's comin through for me.
                 So, either I'm gonna tell all my
                 friends to find their own source,
                 or you give me a bunch of weed,
                 I'll sell it to them, give you the
                 money, minus ten percent, and I
                 get my pot for free."  So, I did
                 if for awhile...

       Another empty frame, except obviously outside.  Freddy
       enters frame from the same direction he exited in the
       previous scene, finishing his sentence.  When we move to a
       wider shot we see Freddy performing his monolog to
       Holdaway in a parking lot.  Holdaway sits on the hood of
       his beat-up car.  Freddy paces back and forth as he
       performs his story.

<b>                              FREDDY
</b>                 ...but then that got to be a pain
                 in the ass.  People called me on
                 the phone all the fuckin time.  I
                 couldn't rent a fuckin tape
                 without six phone calls
                 interrupting me.  "Hey, Freddy,
                 when's the next time you're gettin
                 some?"  "Motherfucker, I'm tryin
                 to watch 'Lost Boys'-- when I have
                 some, I'll let you know."  And
                 then these rinky-dink pot heads
                 come by--there's my friends and
                 everything, but still.  I got all
                 my shit laid out in sixty dollar
                 bags.  Well, they don't want sixty
                 dollars worth.  They want ten
                 dollars worth.  Breaking it up is
                 a major fuckin pain in the ass.  I
                 don't even know how much ten
                 dollars worth is.  "Well, fuck,
                 man, I don't want that much
                 around.  If I have that much
                 around I'll smoke it."  "Hey, if
                 you guys can't control your
                 smokin, that's not my problem.
                 You motherfuckers been smokin for
                 five years, be a adult about it."
                 Finally I just told my connection,
                 count me out.  But as it turns
                 out, I'm the best guy she had, and
                 she depended alot on my business.
                 But I was still sick to death of
                 it.  And she's trying to talk me
                 into not quitin.
                 Now this was a very weird
                 situation, 'cause I don't know if
                 you remember back in '86, there
                 was a major fuckin drought.
                 Nobody and anything.  People were
                 livin on resin and smokin the wood
                 in their pipes for months.  And
                 this chick had a bunch, and was
                 beggin me to sell it.  So I told
                 her I wasn't gonna be Joe the Pot
                 Man anymore.  But I would take a
                 little bit and sell it to my
                 close, close, close friends.  She
                 agreed to that, and said we'd keep
                 the same arrangement as before,
                 ten percent and free pot for me,
                 as long as I helped her out that
                 weekend.  She had a brick of weed
                 she was sellin, and she didn't
                 want to go to the buy alone...

                 his right hand's still going for
                 the glove box.

       The CAMERA PANS away from the sheriffs to Freddy, up
       against the urinal, playing possum, pretending to piss.

<b>                              SHERIFF #2 (O.S.)

                 Put your hands on the dash like

                 and casually puts his hands on the
                 dash.

       Freddy finishes his playing possum piss, and walks past
       the sheriffs over to the sink.  The CAMERA PANS with him.
       A sheriff is sitting on a sink.  He looks down and watches

       Freddy finishes washing his hands.  He goes to dry them,
       but there's only those hand drying machines.  Freddy turns
       on the drying machine.  He can't hear anything the

<b>                              JODIE
</b>                 Back in '83, got out late '86.  I
                 found something else out I think
                 you two should be aware of.
                 About a year and a half ago, up in
                 Sacramento, an undercover cop,
                 John Dolenz, worked his way into a
                 bank job.  Apparently before the
                 job they found out he was a cop.
                 Now picture this:  It's Dolenz's
                 birthday, a bunch of cops are
                 waiting in his apartment for a
                 surprise party.  The door opens,
                 everyone yells "Surprise!", and
                 standing in the doorway is Dolenz
                 and this other guy sticking a gun
                 in Dolenz's ribs.  Before anybody
                 knows what's going on, this
                 stranger shoots Dolenz dead and
                 starts firing two .45 automatics
                 into the crowd.

       The DOLLY moves behind Jodie.

<b>                              JODIE
</b>                 It was a mess.  Cops got hit,
                 wives got hit, girlfriends got
                 hit, his dog got hit.  People got
                 glass in their faces.  Three were
                 killed, six were wounded.

<b>                              FREDDY
</b>                 They couldn't pin the killing on
                 one of the bank robbers?

<b>                              JODIE
</b>                 They tried, but they didn't have a
                 positive I.D. and all those guys
                 had alibis.  Besides, we really
                 didn't have anything on them.  We
                 had the testimony of a dead man
                 that they were talking
                 about committing a robbery.  They
                 never went ahead with the bank
                 job.

       The DOLLY completes its circle.

                 Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a
                 man-eater-upper.  I bet every guy
                 who's ever met her has jacked off
                 to her at least once.  You know
                 who she looked like?  Christie
                 Love.  'Member that TV show "Get
                 Christie Love"?  She was a black
                 female cop.  She always used to

                 So I asked him "Hey, Carlos,
                 where's Lady E tonight?"  Well
                 apparently Lady E was married to
                 this real piece of dog shit.  I
                 mean a real animal.  And
                 apparently he would so things to
                 her.

<b>                              FREDDY
</b>
                 Do things?  What would he do?  You
                 mean like beat her up?

<b>                              EDDIE
</b>                 Nobody knows for sure what he did.
                 We just know he did something.
                 Anyway, Elois plays it real cool.
                 And waits for the next time this
                 bag of shit gets drunk.  So one
                 night the guy gets drunk and
                 passes out on the couch.  So while
                 the guy's
                 inebriated, she strips him naked.
                 Then she takes some crazy glue and
                 glues his dick to his belly.

       The car reacts to how horrible that would be.

<b>                              EDDIE
</b>                 I'm dead fuckin serious.  She put
                 some on his dick and some on his
                 belly, then stuck 'em together.
                 The paramedics had to come and cut
                 it loose.

       The car reacts badly.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 Jesus Christ!

<b>                              FREDDY
</b>                 You can do some crazy things with
                 it.

<b>                              EDDIE
</b>                 I don't know what he did to her,
                 but she got even.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 Was he all pissed off?

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 How would you feel if you had to
                 do a handstand every time you took
                 a piss.

       The car laughs.


<b>42     EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY
</b>
       Nice Guy Eddie pulls up outside the warehouse.
       The four men climb out of the car and follow Eddie inside.


<b>43     INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY
</b>
       The four men enter the building.

       At the other end of the warehouse, sitting in chairs, are
       Mr. Blonde, Mr. Brown, Mr. Blue and Joe Cabot.

       We shoot this from OVERHEAD, looking down on the men.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                         (to everybody)
                 ...So they're talkin about how
                 they get their wives off, and the
                 French guys says:
                        (in a bad French
                         accent)
                 "All I gotta do is take my pinky
                 and tickle my Fifi's little oo la
                 la  and she rises a foot off the
                 bed."

       Back to Joe.

                 So the dago says:


<b>       CU ON JOE

<b>                              JOE

                           accent)
                 "That's nothin.  When I take the
                 tip of my tongue and wiggle it
                 against my Mary Louise's little
                 fun pimple, she rises two feet off
                 da bed."  Then our friend from
                 Poland says:
                         (in dumb voice)
                 "You guys ain't no cocksmen. When

                 you know what?  She hits the

       Joe laughs like a crazy man.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                 Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

       We hear a lot of laughing OFF SCREEN.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                 Ain't that a masterpiece?  Stupid

       Joe's eyes greet the new arrivals.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                 You're here, great!

       Joe EXITS C.U.

       We now have everybody from the Uncle Bob's Pancake House
       scene together again.  Some sit on folding chairs, some
       stand.  Joe sits in front of them on the edge of a table.
       A blackboard with a layout of the jewelry store is off to
       the right.

       We do a 360 around the men.

<b>                              EDDIE
</b>                 We woulda gotten here sooner, but
                 we got backed up around La Brea
                 and Pico.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                 No hurry.
                         (to the boys)
                 All right, let's get to know one
                 another.  With the exception of
                 Eddie and myself, who you already
                 know, you'll be using aliases.
                 Under no circumstances are you to
                 tell one another your real name or
                 anything else about yourself.
                 That includes where you're from,
                 your wife's name, where you
                 might've done time, about a bank
                 in St. Petersburg you might've
                 robbed.  You guys don't say shit
                 about who you are, where you been
                 or what you've done.  Only thing
                 you guys can talk about is what
                 you're going to do.  This way the
                 only ones who know who the members
                 of the team are are Eddie and
                 myself.  And that's the way I like
                 it.  Because in the unlikely event
                 of one of you getting apprehended
                 by the cops, not that I expect
                 that to happen - it most
                 definitely should not happen - it
                 hasn't happened, you don't have
                 anything to deal with.  You don't
                 know any names.  You know my name,
                 you know Eddie's name.  That I
                 don't care about.  You gotta prove
                 it.  I ain't worried.  Besides,
                 this way you gotta trust me.  I
                 like that.  I set this up and
                 picked the men I wanted for it.
                 None of you came to me, I
                 approached all of you.  I know
                 you.  I know your work, I know
                 your reputation.  I know you as
                 men.  Except for this guy.

       Joe points a finger at Freddy.

       Freddy shits a brick.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                 But he's OK.  If he wasn't OK, he
                 wouldn't be here.  Okay, let me
                 introduce everybody to everybody.
                 But once again, at the risk of
                 being redundant, if I even think I
                 hear somebody telling or referring
                 to somebody by their Christian
                 name...
                         (Joe searches for the
                          right words)
                 ...you won't want to be you.
                 Okay, quickly.
                         (pointing at the men
                          as he gives them a
                          name)
                 Mr. Brown, Mr. White, Mr. Blonde,

<b>                              JOE
</b>                 I tried that once, it don't work.
                 You get four guys fighting over
                 who's gonna be Mr. Black.  Since
                 nobody knows anybody else, nobody
                 wants to back down.  So forget it,
                 I pick.  Be thankful you're not
                 Mr. Yellow.

<b>                              MR. BROWN
</b>                 Yeah, but Mr. Brown?  That's too
                 close to Mr. Shit.

       Everybody laughs.

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 Yeah, Mr. Pink sounds like Mr.
                 Pussy.  Tell you what, let me be
                 Mr. Purple.  That sounds good to
                 me, I'm Mr. Purple.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                 You're not Mr. Purple, somebody
                 from another job's Mr. Purple.
                 You're Mr. Pink.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 Who cares what your name is?  Who
                 cares if you're Mr. Pink, Mr.

<b>                              MR. PINK

                 say, you're Mr. White.  You gotta
                 cool-sounding name.  So tell me,
                 Mr. White, if you think "Mr. Pink"

                 Mr. Pink.  We got two ways here,
                 my way or the highway.  And you
                 can go down either of 'em.  So

       CAMERA leaves the team and goes to the blackboard

<b>44     EXT. BLEACHERS - DAY
</b>
       Freddy and Holdaway sit on some bleachers in an empty
       little league baseball field.

<b>                              HOLDAWAY
</b>                 Okay, we're gonna station men
                 across the street from Karina's
                 Fine Jewelry.  But their orders
                 will be not to move in unless the
                 robbery gets out of control.  You
                 gotta make sure they don't have to
                 move in.  You're inside to make
                 sure that everything goes
                 according to Hoyle.  We have men
                 set up a block away from the
                 warehouse rendezvous.  They got
                 complete visibility of the
                 exterior.  So as soon as Joe Cabot
                 shows up, we'll see it.

<b>                              FREDDY

<b>                              HOLDAWAY
</b>                 We can't see shit on the inside.
                 And we can't risk gettin any
                 closer for fear they'll spot us.

<b>                              FREDDY
</b>                 This is bullshit, Jim.  I get all
                 the fuckin danger of having you
                 guys in my back pocket but none of
                 the safety.

<b>                              HOLDAWAY
</b>                 What's the matter, Newendyke?  Job
                 too tough for ya?  No one lied to
                 you.  You always knew we'd hang
                 back until Joe Cabot showed up.

<b>                              FREDDY
</b>                 Oh this is great.  You ain't
                 giving me no fuckin protection
                 whatsoever.  But you are giving me
                 an attitude.

<b>                              HOLDAWAY
</b>                 Since when does an undercover cop
                 have protection?  Freddy, you came
                 into this thing with your eyes
                 wide open, so don't start screamin
                 blind man now.  I understand
                 you're nervous.  I wish the
                 warehouse had more visible
                 windows, but it doesn't.  We have
                 to make do with the cards we're
                 dealt.

<b>                              FREDDY
</b>                 I didn't say I wasn't gonna do it.
                 I'm just remarking on how shitty
                 the situation is!

<b>                              HOLDAWAY
</b>                 I don't mean to be harsh with ya,
                 but I've found tough love works
                 best in these situations.  We have
                 to get Joe Cabot in the company of
                 the thieves and in the same
                 vicinity as the loot.
                 We don't care about these other
                 bastards.  We're willing to offer
                 them good deals to testify against
                 Cabot.

<b>                              FREDDY

<b>                              HOLDAWAY
</b>                 What?

<b>                              FREDDY
</b>                 Letting them go ahead with the
                 robbery?

<b>                              HOLDAWAY
</b>                 The whole idea behind this
                 operation is to catch Joe Cabot
                 red-handed.  We bust these hired
                 hands, we ain't accomplished shit.
                 Letting them go through with the
                 heist is a risk, but Cabot's jobs
                 are very clean.  We got people
                 surrounding the perimeter.  We got
                 a guy and a gal on the inside
                 posing as a couple shopping for

       CUSTOMERS coming and going.  STORE CLERKS waiting on
       customers through the windows.

       While we look at this we HEAR over the soundtrack Mr.

       Mr. White and Freddy sit in a car parked across the street
       from the jewelry store, staking it out.

<b>                              MR. WHITE

                 diamonds.  We're there for those
                 stones, period.  Since no display
                 cases are being fucked with, no
                 alarms should go off.  We're out
                 of there in two minutes, not one
                 second longer.  What if the
                 manager won't give up the
                 diamonds?

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 When you're dealing with a store
                 like this, they're insured up the
                 ass.  They're not supposed to give
                 you and resistance
                 whatsoever.  If you get a customer
                 or an employee who thinks he's
                 Charles Bronson, take the butt of
                 your gun and smash their nose in.
                 Drops 'em right to the floor.
                 Everyone jumps, he falls down,
                 screaming, blood squirts out his
                 nose.  Freaks everybody out.
                 Nobody says fuckin shit after
                 that.  You might get some bitch
                 talk shit to ya.  But give her a
                 look, like you're gonna smash her
                 in the face next.  Watch her shut
                 the fuck up.  Now if it's a
                 manager, that's a different story.
                 The managers know better than to
                 fuck around.  So if one's givin
                 you static, he probably thinks
                 he's a real cowboy.  So what you
                 gotta do is break that son-of-a-
                 bitch in two.  If you wanna know
                 something and he won't tell you,
                 cut off one of his fingers.  The
                 little one.  Then you tell 'im his
                 thumb's next.  After that he'll
                 tell ya if he wears ladies
                 underwear.  I'm hungry, let's get

<b>47     EXT. ALLEY - DAY
</b>
       It's the moment of the robbery.  The alley is empty.

       In the distance we hear all hell breaking loose.  Guns
       FIRING, people SHOUTING and SCREAMING, sirens WAILING,
       glass BREAKING...

       A car whips around the corner, into the alley.

       The doors BURST open, Freddy and Mr. White hop out.

       Freddy opens the driver's side door.  A bloody SCREAMING
       Mr. Brown FALLS out.

<b>                              MR. BROWN

<b>                              FREDDY
</b>                 You're not blind, there's just
                 blood in your eyes.

       Mr. White loads his two .45 automatics.  He RUNS to the
       end of the alley just as a police car comes into SIGHT.

       FIRING both .45's, Mr. White massacres everyone in the
       patrol car.

       Freddy, holding the dying Mr. Brown, looks on at Mr.
       White's ambush in shock.

       Mr. Brown lifts his head up, blood in his eyes.

<b>                              MR. BROWN
</b>                 Mr. Orange?  You're Mr. Orange,
                 aren't you?

       By the time Freddy turns his head back to him, Mr. Brown
       is dead.

       Mr. White RUNS up to Freddy.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 Is he dead?

       Freddy doesn't answer, he can't.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 Did he did or not?

       Freddy, scared.

<b>                              FREDDY
</b>                 I'm sorry.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 What?  Snap out of it!

       Mr. White GRABS Freddy by the coat and YANKS him along as
       he RUNS.

       They EXIT the alley and FLEE down a street.

       A car with a FEMALE DRIVER comes up on the two men.

       Mr. White JUMPS in her path, stopping the car.  He points
       his jun at her.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 Get us outta here!

       Mr. White climbs into the backseat.

       Freddy starts to climb in.

       The Female driver comes up with a gun from under her seat.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 The bitch's got a gun!

       She SHOOTS Freddy in the stomach.

       On instinct Freddy brings up his gun and SHOOTS her in the
       face.


<b>       C.U. ON FREDDY
</b>
       as he FALLS to the ground he realizes what's happened
       to him and what he's done.  SLOW MOTION.

       Mr White DRAGS the dead female driver out of the car.  He
       SHOVES Freddy in the backseat and DRIVES away.

                 about what he was going to do when
                 he was slicing him up.

<b>                              EDDIE
</b>                 I don't buy it.  It doesn't make
                 sense.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 It makes perfect fuckin sense to
                 me.  Eddie, you didn't see how he
                 acted during the job, we did.

       Mr. Pink walks over to the cop's body.

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 He's right about the ear, it's
                 hacked off.

<b>                              EDDIE
</b>                         (to Mr. Orange)
                 Let me say this out loud, just to
                 get it straight in my mind.
                 According to you, Mr. Blonde was
                 gonna kill you.  Then when we came
                 back, kill us, grab the diamonds,
                 and scram.  That's your story?
                 I'm correct about that, right?

<b>                              MR. ORANGE
</b>                 Eddie, you can believe me or not
                 believe me, but it's the truth.  I
                 swear on my mother's eternal soul
                 that's what happened.

       The CAMERA mover into a C.U. of Nice Guy Eddie.

       There's a long pause while he rolls over what Mr. Orange
       has said.  Finally:

<b>                              EDDIE
</b>                 You're a fuckin liar.  Now why
                 don't you drop the fuckin fairy
                 tale and tell me what really
                 happened?

<b>                              MR. WHITE (OS)
</b>                 He told you what really happened.
                 You just can't deal with it.

<b>                              MR. ORANGE (OS)
</b>                 Okay, you're right, I'm lying.
                 Even though I'm fuckin dyin I'm
                 not above pullin a fast one.  Get
                 rid of Blonde, we share his split
                 - no, scratch that, I shot him
                 'cause I didn't like his hair
                 style.  I didn't like his shoes
                 either.  If it has just been his
                 hair, I'd've maybe, maybe I said,
                 let him live.  But hair and
                 footwear together, he's a goner.

<b>                              EDDIE
</b>                 The man you killed was just
                 released from prison.  He got
                 caught at a company warehouse full
                 of hot items.  He could've walked
                 away.  All he had to do was say my
                 dad's name.  But instead he shut
                 his mouth and did his time.  He
                 did four years for us, and he did
                 'em like a man.  And we were very
                 grateful.  So, Mr. Orange, you're
                 tellin me this very good friend of
                 mine, who did four years for my
                 father, who in four years never
                 made a deal, no matter what they
                 dangled in front of him, you're
                 telling me that now, that now this
                 man is free, and we're making good
                 on our commitment to him, he's
                 just gonna decide, right out of
                 the fuckin blue, to rip us off?

       Silence.

<b>                              EDDIE
</b>                 Mr. Orange, why don't you tell me
                 what really happened?

<b>                              VOICE (OS)
</b>                 Why?  It'll just be more bullshit.

       Eddie steps out of his C.U. and we see Joe Cabot standing
       in the warehouse doorway.  He walks into the room.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                         (pointing to Mr.

                 This man set us up.

       CAMERA does a 360 around the men.

<b>                              EDDIE
</b>                 Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know

<b>                              JOE

<b>                              MR. WHITE

<b>                              MR. WHITE   MR. PINK   EDDIE

<b>       MR. ORANGE'S POV
</b>
       Looking up from the floor at everybody.

       Joe looks down at Mr. Orange.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                 Aren't you?

<b>                              MR. ORANGE (OS)
</b>                 I don't have the slightest fuckin
                 idea what you're talkin about.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                         (very calmly to Joe)
                 Joe, I don't know what you think
                 you know, but you're wrong.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                 Like hell I am.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                         (very calmly)
                 Joe, trust me on this, you've made
                 a mistake.  He's a good kid. I
                 understand you're hot, you're
                 super-fuckin pissed.  We're all
                 real emotional.  But you're
                 barking up the wrong tree.  I know
                 this man, and he wouldn't do that.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                 You don't know jack shit.  I do.
                 This rotten bastard tipped off the
                 cops and got Mr. Brown and Mr.
                 Blue killed.

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 Mr. Blue's dead?

<b>                              JOE
</b>                 Dead as Dillinger.

<b>                              EDDIE
</b>                 The motherfucker killed Vic.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 How do you know all this?

<b>                              JOE
</b>                 He was the only one I wasn't a
                 hundred percent on.  I should have
                 my fucking head examined for goin
                 forward when I wasn't a hundred
                 percent.  But he seemed like a
                 good kid, and I was impatient and
                 greedy and all the things that
                 fuck you up.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                         (screaming)
                 That's your proof?

<b>                              JOE
</b>                 You don't need proof when you got
                 instinct.  I ignored it before,
                 but not no more.

       He WHIPS out a revolver and aims it at Mr. Orange.

       Mr. White brings his .45 up at Joe.

       Eddie and Mr. Pink are shook awake by the flash of
       firearms.

       Eddie raises his gun, pointing it at Mr. White.

<b>                              EDDIE
</b>                 Have you lost your fucking mind?
                 Put your gun down!

       Mr. Pink fades into the B.G., wanting no part of this.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 Joe, you're making a terrible
                 mistake I can't let you make.

<b>                              EDDIE
</b>                 Stop pointing your fuckin gun at
                 daddy!

       Joe, never taking his eyes off Mr. Orange.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                 Don't worry, Eddie.  Me and Larry
                 have been friends a long time, he
                 ain't gonna shoot.  We like each
                 other too much.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 Joe, if you kill that man, you die
                 next.  Repeat, if you kill that
                 man, you die next!

       We get many different angles of the Mexican standoff.


<b>       MEDIUMS ON EVERYBODY
</b>
       Mr. Orange holding his belly, looking from left to right.

       Joe pointing down on Mr. Orange.  Not taking his eyes off
       him.

       Mr. White pointing at Joe, looking like he's ready to
       start firing any minute.

       Eddie scared shitless for his father, gun locked on Mr.
       White.

       Mr. Pink walking backwards away from the action.

       Nobody says nothing.


<b>       FOUR SHOT
</b>
       of guys ready for violence.  Mr. Pink in the B.G.

<b>                              MR. PINK
</b>                 C'mon, guys, nobody wants this.
                 We're supposed to me fuckin
                 professionals!

       Joe raises his head to Mr. White.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                 Larry, I'm gonna kill him.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do
                 this!

<b>                              JOE
</b>                 Larry, I'm askin you to trust me
                 on this.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                 Don't ask me that.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                 I'm not askin, I'm betting.

       Joe's eyes go back to Mr. Orange.

<b>                              EDDIE
</b>                 Daddy, don't!

       Joe FIRES three times, HITTING Mr. Orange with every one.

       Mr. White SHOOTS Joe twice in the face.  Joe brings his
       hands up to his face, screaming, and falls to the ground.

       Eddie FIRES at Mr. White, HITTING him three times in the
       chest.

       Mr. White brings his gun around on Eddie and SHOOTS him.

       The two men FALL to their knees, FIRING at each other.

       Eddie COLLAPSES, dead.

       Joe's dead.

       Mr. Orange lies perfectly still, except for his chest
       heaving.  The only SOUND we hear is his loud breathing.

       Mr. White is SHOT full of holes, but still on his knees,
       not moving.

       Mr. Pink is standing motionless.  Finally he grabs the
       satchel of diamonds and RUNS out the door.

       We hear outside a CAR START.  Then the SOUND of a BULLHORN
       yells out:

<b>                              POLICE FORCE (OS)
</b>                 Freeze! Get out of the car and lie
                 face down on the ground!

<b>                              MR. PINK (OS)
</b>                 Don't shoot!

       We now hear SIRENS, the SOUNDS of more CARS DRIVING UP,
       MEN RUNNING to the warehouse.

       While all this noise is going on, Mr. White tries to stand
       but FALLS DOWN.  He somehow makes it to where Mr. Orange
       lies.

       He lifts Mr. Orange's head, cradling it in his lap and
       stroking his brow.

<b>                              MR. WHITE
</b>                         (with much effort)
                 Sorry, kid.  Looks like we're
                 gonna do a little time.

       Mr. Orange looks up at him and, with even more of an
       effort:

<b>                              MR. ORANGE
</b>                 I'm a cop.

       Mr. White doesn't say anything, he keeps stroking Orange's
       brow.

<b>                              MR. ORANGE
</b>                 I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

       Mr. White lifts his .45 and places the barrel between Mr.
       Orange's eyes.

       The CAMERA MOVES into an EXTREME C.U. of Mr White.

       The SOUNDS of outside STORM inside.  We don't see
       anything, but we HEAR a bunch of shotguns COCKING.

<b>                              POLICE FORCE (OS)
</b>                 Freeze, motherfucker!  Drop your
                 fucking gun!
<b>       
</b>       Mr White looks up at them, smiles, PULLS the trigger.

<b>       BANG
</b>
       We hear a BURST of SHOTGUN FIRE.

       Mr. White is BLOWN out of frame, leaving it empty.
