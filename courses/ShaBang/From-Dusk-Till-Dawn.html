<b>	FADE IN:
</b>
<b>	EXT. LIQUOR STORE - DAY
</b>
	A convenience store in a Texas Suburb. No other businesses
	surround it.

	CLOSE-UP: A light switch is flipped on.

	The sign on top of the store lights up. It reads: BENNY'S
<b>	WORLD OF LIQUOR.
</b>
<b>	TITLE CARD:
</b>
<b>				BIG SPRING, TEXAS
</b><b>			   109 MILES WEST OF ABILENE
</b><b>			345 MILES EAST OF THE MEXICAN BORDER
</b>
	A Texas Ranger patrol car pulls into the parking lot and
	a real live Texas Ranger, EARL MCGRAW, steps out. McGraw is
	in full ranger uniform - button shirt, cowboy hat, boots,
	mirrored shades, tin star and a colt revolver on his hip.

	It's about an hour and a half before sundown and McGraw is
	off duty for the day.

	The only other car in the parking lot is a 1975 Plymouth


<b>	INT. BENNY'S WORLD OF LIQUOR - DAY
</b>
	A young Hawaiian Shirt wearing man named PETE sits on a
	stool behind the counter.

	A few CLOSE-UP:STOMERS fiddle about.

	A MAN wearing a black suit, black tie, and wire rim
	glasses holds hands with a PRETTY BLONDE GIRL in cutoffs and
	bare feet. They look through magazines.

	Another black suit wearing MAN holds hands with a RED-HEADED
	GIRL in a prep school uniform. They look through the
	beer cooler in the back of the store. Both girls are around
	seventeen.

	MCGRAW enters the store.

<b>				MCGRAW
</b>		Hot goddamn day!

<b>				PETE
</b>		Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside with
		the air conditioner blastin' all day
		long.

<b>				MCGRAW
</b>		Not even for lunch?

<b>				PETE
</b>		I'm by myself today, ate my lunch
		outta the microwave.

	McGraw walks over to the beer cooler, as if done ritually
	every night (it is), takes out a beer, pops it open and
	joins Pete by the front counter.

<b>				MCGRAW
</b>		Jesus Christ man, that microwave food
		will kill ya as quick as a bullet.
		Those burritos are only fit for a
		hippie high on weed. Pull me down a
		bottle of Jack Daniels. I'm gettin'
		tanked tonight.

<b>				PETE
</b>		Whatsamatter?

<b>				MCGRAW
</b>			(sighs)
		Awww, it's just been a shitass day.
		Every inch of it hot and miserable.
		First off, Nadine at the Blue Chip
		got some sorta sick, so that Mongoloid
		boy of hers was workin' the grill.
		That fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit
		from Rice Krispies. I ate breakfast
		at nine, was pukin' up pigs in a
		blanket like a sick dog by ten
		thirty.

<b>				PETE
</b>		Isn't there a law or something
		against retards serving food to the
		public?

<b>				MCGRAW
</b>		Well, if there ain't there sure oughta
		be. Who knows what goes on inside 
		Mongoloid's mind?

<b>				PETE
</b>		You could sue the shit out of her, ya
		know. That kid belongs under a circus
		tent, not flippin' burgers. You could
		own that fuckin' place.

<b>				MCGRAW
</b>		What the hell would I do with that
		grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got
		enough of a cross to bear just taking
		care of that potato head. Then all
		this Abilene shit happened. You
		heard about that bank robbery in
		Abilene, didn't ya?

<b>				PETE
</b>		That's all that's been on the box
		all day. They killed some people
		didn't they?

<b>				MCGRAW
</b>		Four Rangers, three cops, and two
		civilians. And they took a lady bank
		teller as a hostage.

	Pete doesn't say anything.

<b>				MCGRAW
</b>		They'll probably make a run for the
		border, which would bring 'em this
		way. And if we get our hands on
		those shit asses, we're talking
		payback time. We'll get 'em all right.
		I gotta piss. I'm gonna use your
		commode.

<b>				PETE
</b>		Knock yourself out.

	McGraw drops his last drip of beer, crushes the can and
	exits in the bathroom.

	The black suited man by the beer cooler turns around and,
	with the prep school girl in tow, walks rapidly toward Pete.
	We see that the girl is crying.

<b>				BLACK SUITED MAN #1
</b>			(to Pete)
		Do you think I'm fuckin' playing with
		you, asshole?
			(points to the tearful prep
			 school girl)
		Do you want this little girl to die?
			(pointing to the blonde with
			 the other guy)
		Or that little girl? Or your
		bosombuddy with the badge? Or
		yourself? I don't wanna do it, but
		I'll turn this fuckin' store into the
		Wild Bunch if I even think you're
		fuckin' with me.

	The two men in black suits are the notorious Abilene
	bank robbers, SETH and RICHARD GECKO, "The Gecko Brothers."
	And the other customers are all being held hostage. Seth
	is the one with the prep girl. Richard is the one with
	the blonde.

	Everybody speaks low and fast.

<b>				PETE
</b>		What do you want from me? I did what
		you said.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Letting him use your toilet? No store
		does that.

<b>				PETE
</b>		He comes in here every day and we
		bullshit. He's used my toilet a
		thousand times. If I told him no,
		he'd know something was up.

<b>				SETH
</b>		I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta
		here, in his car, and down the road or
		you can change the name of this
		place to "Benny's World of Blood."

	Richard, holding tightly the hand of the terrified girl,
	leans next to Seth's ear and whispers something. Seth looks
	at Pete.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Were you giving that pig signals?

<b>				PETE
</b>		What? Are you kidding? I didn't do
		anything!

	Richard whispers something else in Seth's ear.

<b>				SETH
</b>		He says you were scratching.

<b>				PETE
</b>		I wasn't scratching!

<b>				SETH
</b>		You callin' him a liar?

	Pete controls himself.

<b>				PETE
</b>		I'm not calling him a liar, okay? I'm
		simply saying that if I was
		scratching, and if I did scratch, it's
		not because I was signaling the cop,
		it's because I'm fuckin' scared
		shitless.

	Richard speaks for the first time in a low calm voice to
	Seth.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		The Ranger's taking a piss. Why don't
		I just go in there, blow his head off
		and get outta here.

<b>				PETE
</b>		Don't do that! Look, you asked me to
		act natural, and I'm acting as natural
		-- in fact, under the circumstances, I
		think I ought get a fuckin' Academy
		Award for how natural I'm acting. You
		asked me to get rid of him, I'm doing
		my best.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Yeah, well, your best better get a
		helluva lot fuckin' better, or you're
		gonna feel a helluva fuckin' lot
		worse.

	The toilet FLUSHES.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Everybody be cool.

	Everybody goes back to what they were doing.

	McGraw steps back out of the back. He appears to be unaware
	of the situation.

<b>				MCGRAW
</b>		Yeah, and I'm gonna be right back at
		it tomorrow. So tonight I'm gonna sit
		in front of the box and just drink
		booze. How much is the bottle?

<b>				PETE
</b>		Six-fifty.

	Out of nowhere Richard WHIPS out his forty-five automatic
	and SHOOTS McGraw in the head.

	McGraw goes down screaming.

	Richard stands over him and SHOOTS him twice more.

	Seth charges forward.

<b>				SETH
</b>			(to Richard)
		What the fuck was that about?

<b>				RICHARD
</b>			(in a low monotone)
		He signaled the Ranger.

<b>				PETE
</b>			(hysterical)
		I didn't.
			(to Seth)
		You gotta believe me, I didn't.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>			(to Seth)
		When they were talkin', he mouthed
		the words "Help Us."

<b>				PETE
</b>		You fuckin' liar, I didn't say shit!

	Richard SHOOTS Pete and Pete falls down behind the counter.

	Seth grabs Richard and throws him up against the wall.

<b>				SETH
</b>		What the fuck is wrong with you --

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		Seth, he did it. You were by the beer
		cooler with your back turned. I was by
		the magazines, I could see his face.
		And I saw him mouth:

	Richard mouths the words, "Help Us."

	While Pete lies on the floor behind the counter bleeding
	from his bullet wound, he opens his floor safe and pulls
	out a gun from it.

	Seth releases his brother.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Start the car.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		You believe me don't cha?

<b>				SETH
</b>		Shut up and start the car.

	Richard walks away from Seth and crosses the counter...

	...when Pete SPRINGS up, gun in hand, and SHOOTS Richard in
	the hand.

	Richard FALLS to his knees, howling.

	Both Pete and Seth SPRAY the store with gunfire.

	Seth DIVES down an aisle. He reloads.

	Pete DUCKS behind the counter. He reloads.

	Richard has crawled to safety behind an aisle.

	The two girls have run out screaming.


<b>				SETH
</b>			(yelling)
		Richie? You okay?

<b>				RICHARD
</b>			(yelling)
		I'm not dead, but I'm definitely shot!
		I told you that bastard said, "Help
		us!"

<b>				PETE
</b>			(yelling)
		I never said help us!

<b>				SETH
</b>			(yelling)
		Well that don't matter now, 'cause
		you got about two fuckin' seconds
		to live! Richie!

<b>				RICHARD
</b>			(yelling)
		Yeah?

<b>				SETH
</b>			(yelling)
		When I count three, shoot out the
		bottles behind him!

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		Gotcha!

<b>				SETH
</b>		One... Two... Three.


	The two brothers start FIRING toward the counter.

	They HIT the bottles of alcohol on the shelf behind Pete.

	Pete is crouched on the ground as glass, debris and alcohol
	RAIN down on him.

	Seth grabs a roll of paper towels from off a shelf.

	Richard keeps FIRING.

	Seth douses the paper towels with lighter fluid, sets it on
	fire with his Zippo, then tosses it.

	The flaming roll of paper towels FLIES through the air.

	The fireball lands behind the counter.

	The entire counter area immediately BURSTS INTO FLAMES. Pete
	screams from behind the counter.

	Seth smiles to himself and stands.

	Richard shakes his head in amusement and stands.

	Pete runs out from behind the counter, ENGULFED IN FLAMES
	still holding his weapon and FIRING.

	Seth and Richard hit the ground FIRING their .45's.

	Pete, the human torch, FALLS like a tree into the Hostess
	Pastry display.

	Seth and Richard rise from the rubble.



<b>	EXT. BENNY'S WORLD OF LIQUOR - DAY
</b>
	They exit the store squabbling. The store is bursting into
	flames.

<b>				SETH
</b>		What did I tell you? What did I tell
		you? Buy the road map and leave.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		What am I supposed to do, Seth?
		He recognized us.

<b>				SETH
</b>		He didn't recognize shit.

	Both Seth and Richard stand on opposite sides of the car.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		Seth, I'm telling you, the way he
		looked at us -- you especially --
		I knew he knew.


	They both climb in the car, Seth behind the wheel. Seth
	starts it op. The souped up engine ROARS to life. We can
	hear Seth mumbling under the motor.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Low profile. Do you know what the
		words "low profile" mean?

<b>	CLOSE-UP: SETH'S FOOT PUNCHES GAS.
</b>
	The Plymouth tears out of the parking lot backwards, hits
	the street, and speeds off down the road.

	We CRANE UP HIGH to see the car leaving a trail of dust
	behind it, as the store burns out of control.

<b>	OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE.
</b>
	Raunchy, honky-tonk MUSIC fills the theater.

<b>								  CUT TO:
</b>

<b>	EXT. TEXAS PANHANDLE - DAY
</b>
	The Plymouth tears ass across Texas plains. As TITLES PLAY
	OVER, we see Seth and Richard enjoying their getaway/road
	trip. Seth behind the wheel, pops open a bottle of
	prescription pills, empties out four of the red capsules in
	his hand, pops them in his mouth, and washes it back with a
	slug of Jack Daniel's from a pint bottle.

	Richard looks at Seth through the hole in his hand. Like a
	boxer, Richard wraps his wounded hand with gaffer's tape.

	The camera leaves the boys, as they woosh down the street,
	and goes along the length of the car to the trunk. It hangs
	on the trunk. Then we see through the trunk, like Superman:

	AN OLDER WOMAN tied up and helpless in the trunk.

	The rest of the titles play over black as the song
	continues.

<b>	EXT. EMMA AND PETE'S GRAVY TRAIN - DAY
</b>
	Emma and Pete's Gravy Train is a truck stop off of Highway
<b>	290.
</b>
<b>	SUBTITLE APPEARS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN':
</b>
<b>		   FORT STOCKTON
</b><b>		238 MILES FROM THE MEXICAN BORDER
</b>

<b>	INT. EMMA AND PETE'S GRAVY TRAIN - DAY
</b>
	Emma and Pete's PATRONS are made up of regulars, truckers,
	cowboys and road-weary travelers. The CAMERA DOLLIES through
	the maze of tables, patrons, and waitresses.

	It stops when it gets to a table occupied by the FULLER
	FAMILY. The Fullers definitely fall into the road-weary
	category. The members of the unit consist of the father,
	JACOB, age 44, an ex-preacher, a good man with rough edges,
	and his two children, KATE, age 19, is a young beauty who
	possesses what can only be described as an apple pie
	sensuality. She is dressed like a nice Christian girl,
	complete with crucifix. SCOTT, age 16, is a Jacob's
	Vietnamese adopted son. Scott is a likable, long-haired kid
	who always wears a T-shirt with the name of the heavy metal
	garage band he plays guitar for, "Precinct 13." The three
	of them are wolfing down a late lunch.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		We got about two more hours of day
		light left. That'll get us into
		El Paso, which is right next to the
		border. We'll stop at a motel --

<b>				SCOTT
</b>		Stop? We're not going to actually
		stop at a motel, are we?

	Scott and Kate speak together, obviously repeating something
	that Jacob has said about three hundred times.

<b>				SCOTT AND KATE
</b>		We've got a Winnebago. We don't need
		those over priced roach havens. We're
		self contained.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Okay, Okay, maybe I was a little
		overzealous, but give me a break, I
		just bought it.

	Scott and Kate continue the impersonation.

<b>				SCOTT
</b>		Why, just look at all this. You got
		your kitchen --

<b>				KATE
</b>		-- you got your microwave --

<b>				SCOTT
</b>		-- you got your sink --

<b>				KATE
</b>		-- you got your shower --

<b>				SCOTT
</b>		-- see this, television!

<b>				KATE
</b>		Feel this, real wood paneling. That's
		real wood, too, not that fake stuff.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Unless you two wiseacres wanna be
		introduced to the joys of hitchhiking,
		what say we drop this?

<b>				SCOTT
</b>			(to Kate)
		The truth hurts.

<b>				KATE
</b>			(to Scott)
		It's the bitterest of pills.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		You two ought to start a stand-up
		act, because you're just wasting your
		humor on me.

<b>				KATE
</b>		Ain't it the truth.

<b>				SCOTT
</b>		Why do you want to stop?

<b>				JACOB
</b>		I'm exhausted.

<b>				SCOTT
</b>		Lie in the back, Dad, I'll drive us
		into Mexico.

	Jacob gives Scott a look that says, "You aren't touching my
	new motor home."

<b>				JACOB
</b>		I just bet you would. Don't even thin
		about it. Besides, I want to have one
		night's sleep in an
		honest-to-goodness bed. The beds in
		the home are okay, but they're not
		like a real bed.

<b>				KATE
</b>		Hey, if we go to a motel, we can
		swim.

<b>				SCOTT
</b>		I'll be right back. I'm gonna go to
		the bathroom.

	Scott gets up from the table and walks out back to the
	restroom.

	Jacob and Kate are left alone. There's an awkward moment of
	silence before...

<b>				KATE
</b>		Dad, when I called the machine to
		check our messages there was one from
		Bethel Baptist. Mr.Franklin said he
		wouldn't permanently replace you until
		we came back. He said when we come
		home, if you still feel the same
		way --

<b>				JACOB
</b>		That's very nice of Ted, but I'll
		call him tomorrow and tell him not
		to bother waiting.

<b>				KATE
</b>		I didn't want to talk about this in
		front of Scott because he gets upset.
		But you don't believe in God
		anymore?

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I
		know this is hard on you kids. After
		Jenny's death, this is probably the
		last thing you need. But I can't do
		it any longer. My congregation needs
		spiritual leadership. Well, they can't
		get that from me anymore. My faith is
		gone. To answer your question, yes,
		I do believe in Jesus. But do I love
		them? No. After Jenny died, I just
		thought, what's the point?

<b>				KATE
</b>			(pushing him)
		It's just, all our lives you've been
		a pastor. For twenty years you've
		preached trust in the lord. And then
		one day you wake up and say fuck him?

<b>				JACOB
</b>		I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not
		connected anymore.

<b>				KATE
</b>		That happens, you'll get it back.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Kate, give your old man a little
		credit. Every person who chooses the
		service of God as their life's work
		has something in common. I don't care
		if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun,
		a rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many,
		many times during your life you'll
		look at your reflection in the mirror
		and ask yourself, am I a fool? We've
		all done it. I'm not going through a
		lapse. What I've experienced is closer
		to awakening. I'm not trying to shake
		your faith. I've just decided not to
		devote my life to God anymore.

<b>				KATE
</b>		What do you think Mom would say?

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.

	CLOSE UP: COUNTER BELL. A hand slams down on it. RING.


<b>	INT. LOBBY - DEW DROP INN - DAY
</b>
	Seth stands at the front desk of the Dew Drop Inn. A
	standard issue Texas motel. Richard sits outside in the car.
	Nobody responds to the bell. Seth BANGS it impatiently five
	times.

<b>				TEXAS VOICE (O.S.)
</b>		Hold your horses!

	An OLD-TIMER walks through a curtain behind the counter.
	He's eating a BBQ rib.

<b>				OLD-TIMER
</b>			(rough)
		Whatcha want?

<b>				SETH
</b>		Whatcha think I want, ya mean old
		bastard? I wanna room.


<b>	EXT. COURTYARD - DEW DROP INN - DAY
</b>
	Richard sits in the car listening to Merle Haggard on the
	radio. He watches from his perspective, Seth taking the
	walking outside and getting in the car. Seth starts it up,
	and drives them to their room.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		Do they have cable?

<b>				SETH
</b>		No.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		Do they have an X-rated channel?

<b>				SETH
</b>		No.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		Do they have a waterbed?

<b>				SETH
</b>		They don't have anything except four
		walls and a roof, and that's all we
		need.

	Their car drives up to room #9, but they park backing up the
	trunk close to the door.

	The two brothers get out of the car.

<b>				SETH
</b>			(tossing Richie the motel keys)
		Open the door. We gotta do this fast.

	Richie opens the door.

	Seth goes to the trunk, looks around the court yard. It's
	empty.

	CLOSE UP: KEY going into the trunk lock, turning.

	TRUNK POV: Seth looking into the camera.

	SETH'S POV: A WOMAN in her late forties is lying scrunched
		up in the trunk.

	She is the HOSTAGE BANK TELLER from Abilene. She's stiff,
	scared and looks an absolute mess.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Don't say a word.

	The two brothers, quick as lightening, yank the woman out of
	the trunk and whisk her into the motel room. SETH closes the
	trunk, looks around for any Johnny eye-witnesses, doesn't
	see any, slams the door.


<b>	INT. SETH AND RICHARD'S ROOM - DAY
</b>
	Seth turns from the door, sees the hostage woman standing.

<b>				SETH
</b>		You. Plant yourself in that chair.

	She sits down in the chair.

<b>				HOSTAGE
</b>		What are you planning on doing with --

<b>				SETH
</b>		-- I said plant yourself. Plants don't
		talk. You wanna get on my good side?
		Just sit still and don't make a peep.

	She shuts up.

	Richard slowly takes off his jacket. He winces from his
	wound.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Let me help you.

	He helps him get his jacket off.

<b>				SETH
</b>		How's it feel?

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		How ya think, it hurts like a
		son-of-a-bitch.

	Richie goes over to the bed and lies down on it. Seth takes
	the pillow and stacks them for Richie to prop his back up
	against.

<b>				SETH
</b>		I got both rooms on either side of us,
		so we don't gotta worry about
		eavesdropping assholes. How's that
		feel? You okay?

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		Feels good.

<b>				SETH
</b>		I'm gonna go get the money.

	He heads for the door.


<b>	EXT. COURTYARD - MOTEL - DAY
</b>
	Seth goes into the car, takes out a big suitcase. He scans
	the perimeter with his eyes, goes back inside.


<b>	INT. MOTEL ROOM #9 - DAY
</b>
	Seth comes back in, lays the suitcase on the bed. Richie has
	the TV remote control in his hand and he's flipping
	stations. Seth looks at his watch.

<b>				SETH
</b>		It's about five o'clock.
			(to hostage)
		What time does it get dark around
		here?

<b>				HOSTAGE
</b>		About seven.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Good. I'm going towards the border to
		check things out while it's still
		daylight. Call Carlos and arrange the
		rendezvous.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		Hey, when you talk to him, see if you
		can arrange a better deal than thirty
		percent.

<b>				SETH
</b>		That's their standard deal, brother.
		They ain't about to change it for us.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		Did you even to try to negotiate?

<b>				SETH
</b>		These guys ain't spic fire cracker
		salesman from Tijuana. They don't even
		know the meaning of the word "barter".
		You wanna stay in El Ray? You give
		them thirty percent of your loot. It's
		scripture. So it is written, so shall
		it be done. You want sanctuary, you
		pay the price, and the price is thirty
		percent.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		All I'm saying --

<b>				SETH
</b>		-- This conversation is over.

	Richie shrugs and turns back to TV, Seth turns to the
	hostage, grabs a chair and slides it up in front of her.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Now, we need to have a talk. What's
		your name?

<b>				HOSTAGE
</b>		Gloria.

	He shakes her hand.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Hello, Gloria, I'm Seth and that's my
		brother Richie. Let's cut to the
		chase. I'm gonna ask you a question
		and all I want is a yes or no answer.
		Do you want to live through this?

<b>				GLORIA
</b>		Yes.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Good. Then let me explain the house
		rules. Follow the rules, we'll get
		along like a house on fire. Rule number
		one: No noise, no question. You make a
		noise...
			(he holds up his .45)
		...Mr. 45 makes a noise. You ask a
		question, Mr. 45 answers it. Now are
		you absolutely, positively clear about

</b>		Yes.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Rule number two: You do what we say,
		when we say it. If you don't, see rule
		number one.

	Seth takes the .45, places the barrel next to the woman's
	cheek. She squirms and shuts her eyes. He pulls back the
	hammer.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Rule number three: Don't you ever try
		and fuckin' run on us. 'Cause I got
		five little friends, and they all run
		faster 'n you can. Got it?

	She nods her head yes.

	He takes the gun away and replaces the hammer.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Open your eyes.

	She does.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Gloria, you hang in there, follow the
		rules, and don't fuck with us, you'll
		get out of this alive. I give you my
		word. Okay?

	She nods her head yes.

	Seth rises.

<b>				SETH
</b>		I'll be back in a bit.

	He exits.

	Richard looks to the TV, then looks to Gloria sitting
	across the room in the chair.


<b>				RICHARD
</b>		Wanna come up here on the bed and
		watch TV with me?


	You can tell she doesn't want to.

	He pats the empty space next to him.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		Come on.

	She gets out of her chair, walks across the bed, and sits
	next to him.


<b>	EXT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY
</b>
	A phone booth outside of a gas station. Seth is in the
	middle of a conversation with the party on the other end.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Things are real hot here. Crossing's
		gonna be a bitch.
			(pause)
		Don't worry, we'll get across. But
		when we do, where do we go?
			(pause)
		Can we make it as close to the border
		as possible? Texas wants our balls.
		The quicker we're in your protection,
		the better I'll feel.
			(pause)
		Okay, where?
			(pause)
		The Titty Twister?
			(he laughs)
		I love it already. Okay, Carlos, I'll
		see you and your men at the "Titty
		Twister" tomorrow morning.
			(pause)
		Bye, my friend.

	Seth hangs up the phone, lights up a cigarette with his
	Zippo lighter and exits frame. After Seth exits, leaving
	the frame empty, a subtitle appears:

	Richard lies on the bed by himself, propped up by pillows,

	A local newscaster named KELLY HOUGE is reporting a story

<b>	VIDEO INTERVIEW
</b>
	Kelly Houge interviewing STANLEY CHASE of the FBI.

<b>				STANLEY CHASE
</b>		For the time being we are very
		confident we will apprehend the
		fugitives in the next forty-eight
		hours. The Bureau, local law
		enforcement and the Texas Rangers
		have all joined forces in forming a
		dragnet to snare Seth and Richard
		Gecko.

<b>				KELLY HOUGE
</b>		Agent Chase, does it appear that they
		are heading for Mexico.

<b>				STANLEY CHASE
</b>		Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already
		alerted the Mexican authorities. They
		intend to cooperate every way possible
		in bringing these fugitives to
		justice.

<b>				KELLY HOUGE
</b>		Are you optimistic about the safety of
		the hostage they took in Abilene,
		Gloria Hill?

<b>				STANLEY CHASE
</b>		We've received no news one way or the
		other. We can only hope for the best.

<b>				KELLY HOUGE
</b>		What about the report from an
		eyewitness at the liquor store who
		said one of the brothers was shot?

<b>				STANLEY CHASE
</b>		This can't be confirmed at this time,
		but we do believe it to be true. We
		have reason to believe it was the
		youngest brother Richard, and he was
		shot in the vicinity of his neck and
		shoulders by the store's clerk.

<b>				KELLY HOUGE
</b>		Is it safe to assume that because the
		death count involved and the loss of
		life of law enforcement officers, that
		the Bureau, the Rangers and the police
		force are taking this manhunt
		personally?

<b>				STANLEY CHASE
</b>		I would say that's a very safe
		assumption.

<b>								  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	RICHARD SMILES.
</b>
<b>				RICHARD
</b>			(Newscaster's voice)
		Is it safe to assume since the law
		enforcement authorities in the great
		state of Texas are homosexuals of a
		sick and deviate nature, that they
		will be too busy fucking each other
		up the ass to actually catch The
		Gecko Brothers?
			(in an FBI voice)
		I would say that's a very safe
		assumption.

	He changes a channel on the television. We see a Casper the
	Friendly Ghost cartoon on the screen.

<b>				CASPER
</b>		Would you play with me?

	A big burly COP turns around.

<b>				COP
</b>		Sure, little boy... A GHOST!!!

	The cop heads for the hills. Casper cries.

	Seth enters the room carrying a six pack of beer and two
	take-out bags of Big Kahuna burgers.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		Shit, I started to get worried. Where
		the fuck ya been?

<b>				SETH
</b>		Sight seein'.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		What'd ya see?

<b>				SETH
</b>		Cops.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		Didya look at the border?

	Seth dumps the burgers on the bed. Both men pop open beers
	and Richard goes to town on a hamburger. Seth flips off
	the TV

<b>				SETH
</b>		Yeah, I saw the border. Through
		binoculars from on top of a high
		building. That's about as close as I
		risked getting. What's the TV say?

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		They're going to apprehend us in
		forty-eight hours.

	Seth sits down and takes a hit off his beer.

<b>				SETH
</b>			(to himself)
		I gotta figure a way to get across
		that goddamn border. Longer we fuck
		around El Paso our lives ain't worth
		a shit.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		Look, fuck the border. Let's just dig
		in and wait for things to cool down.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Richie, it's gonna get a lot fuckin'
		worse before it gets any fuckin'
		better. We showed our ass in Texas. We
		killed Texas fuckin' Rangers. They
		ain't gonna stop lookin' till they
		find us, and when they find us,
		they're gonna kill us. Texans take it
		very personal when ya kill their law
		enforcement officers. The El Paso
		police have already started a motel
		and hotel search for us.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		How do you know?

<b>				SETH
</b>		I heard it on the radio. We gotta get
		our asses into Mexico tonight. Carlos
		is gonna meet us tomorrow morning at a
		rendezvous on the other side, then
		Carlos and his boys will escort us to
		El Ray and --

	Seth stops talking and looks around.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Where's the woman?

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		What?

	Seth's out of his chair.

<b>				SETH
</b>		What'd ya mean, what? The fuckin'
		woman, the hostage. Where the fuck
		is she, Richard!?

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		She's in the other room.

<b>				SETH
</b>		What the fuck is she doin' there?!

	He goes to the door of the adjoining room.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		Seth, before you open the door, let
		me explain what happened.

	Seth stops and looks at his brother. He knows what he means.
	He can't say anything, only point at his younger sibling.
	Then he BURSTS open the door.

	The dead, naked body of Gloria Hill lies on the bed. It's
	obvious Richard raped her and killed her.

	Seth covers his eyes with his hands. He slowly enters the
	room with the dead body.

<b>				SETH
</b>			(to himself)
		Oh, Richard, what's wrong with you?

	Richard rises from the bed.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		Now, Seth, before you flip out, let me
		just explain what happened.

	Seth slowly turns to his brother, then walks toward him.

	Richard backs up.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Yeah, explain it to me. I need an
		explanation. What's the matter with
		you?

<b>				RICHARD
</b>			(low and calm)
		There's nothing wrong with me,
		brother. That woman tried to escape
		and I did what I had to do.

<b>				SETH
</b>		No.
			(pause)
		That woman wouldn't of said shit if
		she had a mouthful.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong,
		wrong, wrong! Once you left, she
		became a whole different person.

<b>				SETH
</b>			(slowly approaching)
		Is it me? Is it my fault?

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		It's not your fault, it's her fault!

	Seth grabs Richard and THROWS him in the corner of the room,
	holding tightly to his wrist.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Is this my fault? Do you think this
		is what I am?

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		What?

<b>				SETH
</b>		This is not me! I am a professional
		fucking thief. I steal money. You try
		to stop me, god help you. But I don't
		kill people I don't have to, and I
		don't rape women. What you doin' ain't
		how it's done. Do you understand?

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		Seth, if you were me --

<b>				SETH
</b>		Just say yes! Nothing else, just say
		yes.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		Yes.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Yes, Seth, I understand.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		Yes, Seth, I understand.

	Seth hugs his little brother. Tight.

<b>				SETH
</b>			(whispers in Richie's ear)
		We get into Mexico, it's gonna be
		sweet Rosemary, hundred-proof liquor,
		and rice and beans. None of this
		shit's gonna matter.


<b>	INT. MOTOR HOME - NIGHT
</b>
	Scott and Kate are in the front seat of their parked motor
	home. The motor home's parked in front of the Dew Drop
	Inn's front office. We see Jacob inside getting a room from
	the Old-Timer.

<b>				KATE
</b>		I can't believe he's stopping here.
		This place looks totally cruddy.

	Jacob walks out of the office. Kate yells from the motor
	home.

<b>				KATE
</b>		Dad, why are we stopping here?

	He opens the meter home door and climbs in.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		There's nothing wrong with this
		place.

<b>				KATE
</b>		It's a flop house.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		It's not a flop house. It's basic
		and simple. That doesn't make it a
		flop house.

<b>				KATE
</b>		If it doesn't have a pool, we're
		looking for a new place.

	Starting the huge car and slowly maneuvering it through the
	courtyard.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		It has a bed. That's all I care about.

<b>				KATE
</b>		Other places have beds, they also have
		cable TV, a gym, room service...


<b>	EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT
</b>
	Seth walks out of room #9 with a beer in his hand. He's
	thinking about how he's going to get over the border
	tonight. Lost in thought, he steps out in the path of the
	Fuller's motor home.

	Jacob slams on the brakes. Seth jumps back, startled. Both
	Kate and Scott are TOSSED out of their seats onto the floor.
<b>	THUD... THUD...
</b>
<b>				KATE
</b>		Owww, my head.

	Jacob (pissed) honks his horn at Seth and yells out the
	window.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Watch where you're going!

<b>	THROUGH WINDSHIELD
</b>
	Seth just stands right in their way without moving, gazing
	up at the giant motor home.

<b>	JACOB BEHIND THE WHEEL
</b>
	Kate and Scott join him up front looking at this weirdo.

<b>				SCOTT
</b>		What's this guy's problem?

<b>				JACOB
</b>		I have no idea.

	Seth continues standing in their way, making no attempt to
	move. Not threatening, just looking at them.

<b>	HONK!
</b>
<b>				JACOB
</b>		Anytime, man.

	The horn snaps Seth back to this world. A smile breaks out
	on the escaped fugitive's face and he politely steps to one
	side to let them pass.

	Pass they do!

<b>				KATE
</b>		Creepy guy.

<b>	SETH
</b>
	The Sword of Damocles is lifted from above Seth's head. He's
	just solved a problem that a mere thirty seconds ago seemed
	unsolvable. He knows exactly how he's going to cross the
	border. Whistling a happy tune, he turns and walks back into
	room #9.


<b>	INT. FULLERS' MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
</b>
	The Fullers are in room #12. It's identical to the one that
	the Gecko boys are in, except that the paintings above the
	beds are different. Jacob has fallen asleep in his clothes
	on the bed.

	Scott sits in a chair, headphones on, playing an unplugged
	electric guitar. Kate is nowhere in sight.

	KNOCK... KNOCK... KNOCK... on the door. Scott doesn't hear
	shit but his music. Jacob stirs a bit, but doesn't wake up.
	POUND... POUND... POUND... on the door. Jacob SPRINGS UP.
	He looks over at Scott, who, lost in guitar heaven, is
	oblivious of the knocker, then to the door.

<b>				JACOB
</b>			(yelling)
		What?

	From the other side of the door comes a friendly voice.

<b>				VOICE (O.S.)
</b>		I'm your neighbor in room 9, I hate to
		disturb you, but I'd like to ask a favor.

	Jacob swings his feet to the floor, stands up and walks to
	the door. As he passes Scott, he says, in his direction --

<b>				JACOB
</b>		I hope none of this is disturbing you.

	Scott can't hear him, but when he sees his dad look at him,
	he smiles.

	Jacob opens the door and sees...

	... Richard Gecko standing in the doorway, looking like the
	nicest guy in the entire world.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		Hi there, I'm from room 9, my name is
		Don Cornelius. No, not the Don
		Cornelius from Soul Train. Me and my
		lady friend need some ice and we don't
		seem to have an ice bucket. Could we
		possibly borrow yours? I'll bring it
		right back.

<b>				JACOB
</b>			(still partially asleep)
		Sure.

	We follow Jacob as he turns to the dresser to get the motel
	ice bucket. He grabs it, turns back to the door, takes a
	couple of steps towards it, then stops: in his tracks.

	He sees Richard and Seth both inside the room with the door
	closed, both with .45's in their hands, both aimed at him.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		What is this?

	Seth SLUGS Jacob in the mouth, KNOCKING him to the ground.

<b>				SETH
</b>		It's called a punch.

	Scott suddenly becomes aware of what's going on around him
	and instinctively stands. Richard shoves his .45 in Scott's
	mouth.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		Sit down.

	Scott lowers himself back down onto his seat.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		Good boy.

	Jacob lifts his head off the floor and wipes blood away from
	his lip. He looks at his opponent who stands over him.

<b>				SETH
</b>			(to Jacob)
		What's your name?

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Jacob.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Okay, Jacob, get up and sit your ass
		down on the bed. Make a wrong move and
		I'll shoot you in the face.

	Jacob rises and sits on the edge of the bed.

<b>				SETH
</b>			(to Richard)
		Okay, move the Jap over there.

	Keeping the gun in Scott's mouth, Richard makes Scott rise...

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		Upsy daisy.

	...guiding him over to the bed by his father.

	Richard removes the gun from Scott's mouth and stands next
	to his brother, looking down at their two hostages.

<b>				SETH
</b>			(to his hostages)
		What's the story with you two? You a
		couple of fags?

<b>				JACOB
</b>		He's my son.

<b>				SETH
</b>		How does that happen? You don't look
		Japanese.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		What's this about, money?

<b>				SETH
</b>		It's about money, all right, but not
		yours. You see, me and my brother here
		are in a little hot water and we need
		your assistance.

	The door to room #12 opens and a dripping wet, bikini clad
	Kate walks in.

	The brothers spin their guns in her direction.

	Kate, startled, screams. Jacob and Scott get on their feet
	and move forward. Seth spins back towards the two men, gun
	ready to spit.

<b>				SETH
</b>			(to Scott and Jacob)
		Stop!

	Jacob and Scott freeze.

	Richard moves like quicksilver, shutting the door and
	positioning himself behind the terrified Kate.

<b>				KATE
</b>		What's going on?

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		We're having a wet bikini contest,
		and you just won.

<b>				JACOB
</b>			(to Kate)
		It's okay, honey. Everything's going
		to be all right.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Just listen to daddy, sugar, and don't
		do nothin' stupid.
			(he turns to Jacob and Scott,
			 who are still standing)
		You two, Simon says sit the fuck down!

	They slowly sit.

	Richard can't take his eyes off the dripping wet Kate.

	Both Jacob and Seth see this and neither men like it. Both
	for their own reasons.

<b>				SETH
</b>			(to Jacob)
		Where are the keys to the motor home?

<b>				JACOB
</b>		On the dresser.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Richie, take the keys. Start that big
		bastard up, and drive it up front.

	Richard doesn't move from his position behind Kate. Kate
	feels his eyes on her. She slowly turns and looks at him.

	He looks in her face.

<b>	CLOSE-UP KATE
</b><b>		
</b>	She smiles at him.

<b>				KATE
</b>		Richie, will you do me a favor and eat
		my pussy?

<b>	CLOSE-UP RICHARD
</b><b>		
</b><b>				RICHARD
</b>		Sure.


<b>				SETH (O.S.)
</b>		Richard!

	Richard's eyes go to Seth.

	Everybody is where they were. Kate never turned around.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Not when you get around to it, now.

	Without saying a word, he takes the keys and leaves the
	room.

<b>				SETH
</b>			(pointing at Kate)
		You, Gidget, go in the bathroom and
		put on some clothes.

	She grabs some clothes from the floor and moves towards the
	bathroom.

	Seth GRABS her wrist.

<b>				SETH
</b>		You got three minutes. One second
		longer, I shoot your father in the
		face. Do you understand what I just
		said?

<b>				KATE
</b>		Yes.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Do you believe me?

<b>				KATE
</b>		Yes.

<b>				SETH
</b>		You damn well better. Go.

	She goes into the bathroom.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Look, if you want the motor home, just
		take it and get out.

	Seth grabs a chair and slides it up to his two male
	hostages.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Sorry, Pops, it ain't gonna be that
		easy.

	We hear the motor home "HONK" twice outside.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Get ready to move out, we're all going
		on a little ride.

	Jacob shakes his head "no."

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Not a chance.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Come again?

<b>				JACOB
</b>		If you're taking people, take me. But
		my kids aren't going anywhere with
		you.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Sorry, I need everybody.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		My children are not going with you,
		and that's that.

<b>				SETH
</b>			(angry)
		That's not fuckin' that...
			(holds up his gun)
		this is fuckin' this.
			(he calms down and looks
			 at Scott)
		Go sit over there.

	Scott gets up and walks to the other side of the room,
	leaving the two men alone. Seth speaks in a quiet,
	conversational tone.

<b>				SETH
</b>		I ain't got time to fuck around with
		you, so I'll make this simple. Take
		your kids and get in the car, or I'll
		execute all three of you right now.
			(he cocks the gun and puts
			 it right in Jacob's face)
		What's it gonna be, yes or no answer?

	Jacob looks at him.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Yes.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Good.
			(to Scott)
		Your old man's all right, he just
		saved your life.

	Seth BANGS on the bathroom door.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Times up, Princess.

	The bathroom door opens. Kate stands there, wearing a
	T-shirt, jeans and bare feet.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Okay, ramblers, let's get to rambling.

</b>

<b>	EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT
</b>
	The motor home with the powder-keg interior drives through
	the Lone Star night.


<b>	INT. MOTOR HOME NIGHT
</b>
	Richard's in the back bed area with a gun trained on Kate
	and Scott. The two scared siblings hold hands.

<b>				KATE
</b>		Excuse me.

	Richard zeros in on her.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		What?

<b>				KATE
</b>		Where are you taking us?

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		Mexico.

<b>				KATE
</b>		What's in Mexico?

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		Mexicans.

	He doesn't smile.

	In the front part of the motor home, Jacob sits behind the
	wheel, driving into the night. Seth sits in the passenger
	seat, going through Jacob's wallet and talking to him
	calmly.

<b>				SETH
</b>			(reading his driver's license)
		Jacob Fuller. Jacob, that's biblical,
		ain't it? What am I askin' for, of
		course it is.
			(motioning behind him)
		What are their names?

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Scott and Kate.

	Seth repeats the names as he thumbs through the wallet.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Scott and Kate... Kate and Scott...
		Scott Fuller... Kate Fuller...

	Seth comes to a snapshot of Jacob and his wife.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Who's this?

<b>				JACOB
</b>		My wife.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Where is the little lady?

<b>				JACOB
</b>		In heaven.

<b>				SETH
</b>		She's dead?

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Yes, she is.

<b>				SETH
</b>		How'd she die?

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Auto wreck.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Come on, gimme some more details.
		How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk
		kill her?

<b>				JACOB
</b>		No. It was a rainy night, the brakes
		on the car weren't great. She had to
		stop suddenly. She slid on the road,
		she crashed, she died.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Died instantly?

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Not quite. She was trapped in the
		wreck for about six hours before she
		passed on.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Whewww! Those acts of God really stick
		it in and break it off, don't they?

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Yes, they do.

	Seth looks back at the wallet. He sees Jacob's minister's
	license.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Is this real?

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Yes.

<b>				SETH
</b>		I've seen one of these before. A
		friend of mine had himself declared
		a minister of his own religion. Away
		to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're
		doing, or are you the real McCoy?

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Real McCoy.

<b>				SETH
</b>		You're a preacher?

<b>				JACOB
</b>		I was a minister.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Was? As in not anymore?

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Yes.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Why'd ya quit?

<b>				JACOB
</b>		I think I've gotten about as up close
		and personal with you as I'm gonna
		get. Now if you need me like I think
		you need me, you're not gonna kill me
		'cause I won't answer your stupid,
		prying questions. So, with all due
		respect, mind your own business.

<b>				SETH
</b>		I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't
		be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this
		friendly. But you're right, enough
		with the getting to know you shit.
		Now, there's two ways we can play this
		hand. One way is me and you go round
		an' round all fuckin' night. The other
		way, is we reach some sort of an
		understanding. Now, if we go down that
		first path at the end of the day, I'll
		win. But we go down the second, we'll
		both win. Now, I don't give a rat's
		ass about you or your fuckin' family.
		Y'all can live forever or die this
		second and I don't care which. The
		only things I do care about are me
		that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and
		our money. And right now I need to get
		those three things into Mexico. Now,
		stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it
		you don't give a shit about seeing me
		and my brother receiving justice, or
		the bank getting its money back. Right
		now all you care about is the safety
		of your daughter, your son and
		possibly yourself. Am I correct?

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Yes.

<b>				SETH
</b>		I thought so. You help us get across
		the border without incident, stay with
		us the rest of the night without
		trying anything funny, and in the
		morning we'll let you and your family
		go. That way everybody gets what they
		want. You and your kids get out of
		this alive and we get into Mexico.
		Everybody's happy.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		How do I know you'll keep your word?

<b>				SETH
</b>		Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with
		this shit.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		You want me to sit here and be
		passive. The only way being passive in
		this situation makes sense is if I
		believe you'll let us go. I'm not
		there yet. You have to convince me
		you're telling the truth.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Look, dickhead, the only thing you
		need to be convinced about is that
		you're stuck in a situation with a
		coupla real mean motor scooters. I
		don't wanna hafta worry about you all
		fuckin' night. And I don't think you
		wanna be worrying about my brother's
		intentions toward your daughter all
		night. You notice the way he looked
		at her, didn't ya?

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Yes.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Didn't like it, did ya?

<b>				JACOB
</b>		No, I didn't.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Didn't think so. So, as I was saying,
		I'm willing to make a deal. You
		behave, get us into Mexico, and don't
		try to escape. I'll keep my brother
		off your daughter and let you all
		loose in the morning.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		You won't let him touch her?

<b>				SETH
</b>		I can handle Richie, don't worry.

	The two men look at each other for some measure of trust.
	Seth sticks out his hand.

<b>				SETH
</b>		I give you my word.

	Seth can't help but think about the last time he gave his
	word.

<b>				SETH
</b>			(hand sticks out)
		My words, my law. Better you not take
		it, and that's just where we are,
		then take it and not mean it.

	Jacob takes his hand, but looks right into Seth.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		If he touches her, I'll kill him. I
		don't give a fuck how many guns you
		have, nothing will stop me from
		killing him.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Fair enough. You break your word, I'll
		kill all of you.
			(calling to the back)
		Kate, honey!

<b>				KATE
</b>		Yeah.

<b>				SETH
</b>		You must have a bible in here, don't
		cha?

<b>				KATE
</b>		Yeah, we got a bible.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Get it and bring it up here, will
		ya, please?

	Kate goes into a drawer, pulls out a bible and brings it up
	front.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Hold it right there, sweetie pie.
			(to Jacob)
		Put your hand on it.

	Jacob does.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Swear to God, on the Bible, you won't
		try to escape and you'll get us across
		the border.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		I swear to God I won't try to escape
		and I'll do my best to get you into
		Mexico.

<b>				SETH
</b>		You best better get it done, Pops.

	Seth places his hand on the Bible.

<b>				SETH
</b>		I swear to God I'll let you loose in the
		morning. And your daughter will be safe. And I
		also swear if you do anything to fuck me up,
		I'll slit all your throats.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		Did ya mean what you said back there?

	Kate turns to him.

<b>				KATE
</b>		What?

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		In the room. Were you serious, or were
		you just foolin' around? I'm just
		bringing it up, 'cause if you really

<b>				KATE
</b>		Do what?

<b>				RICHARD
</b>			(in a whisper)
		What you said to me in the room.

<b>				KATE
</b>			(whispers back)
		What did I say?

<b>				RICHARD
</b>			(whisper)
		You asked me if I would --

<b>				SETH (O.S.)
</b>		Richard!

<b>				RICHARD
</b>			(to Seth)
		What?

	Seth and Jacob.

<b>				SETH
</b>		I told you to watch those kids, I didn't say

	Richard turns to Kate.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>			(quiet)
		We'll talk later.

	Kate still hasn't a clue what he means.

<b>								  CUT TO:
</b>

<b>	EXT. THE MEXICAN BORDER - NIGHT
</b>
	Automobiles are lined up, waiting one by one to go into
	Mexico. Cop cars with their red and blue lights flashing
	are all over the place. Border Patrol men and Police are
	stopping all cars. Pulling up to the end of the line is the
	Fuller's mobile home.


<b>	INT. MOBILE HOME - NIGHT
</b>
	Jacob at the wheel, Seth in the passenger seat. Seth jumps
	up and goes into action.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Okay everybody, it's show time.
		Richie, take Kate in the bathroom.

	Richard grabs the terrified Kate and drags her in the bathroom,

<b>				SETH
</b>		Scott, you come up front with your
		daddy.

	Scott does. Seth, keeping low, gets behind Jacob.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		I'm telling you, don't hurt her.

<b>				SETH
</b>		As long as you're cool, she'll be
		cool. What're ya gonna say?

<b>				JACOB
</b>		I don't have the slightest idea.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Well, you just keep thinkin' of that
		gun next to Kate's temple.

	Seth disappears into the bathroom with Kate and Richard,
	closing the door behind him.

	Father and son are alone for the first time since this whole
	thing began.

<b>				SCOTT
</b>		What are you gonna do?

<b>				JACOB
</b>		I'm gonna try and get us across the
		border.

<b>				SCOTT
</b>		No, dad, you gotta tell 'em that
		they're back there.

	Jacob is surprised to hear Scott say this.


<b>	INT. BATHROOM - MOBILE HOME - NIGHT
</b>
	The bathroom, which consists of a shower, a toilet and a
	small sink, is a tight fit with three people in it.

	Richard has his back against the wall, with his arm around
	Kate, holding her in front of him. One hand is over her
	mouth, the other holds a .45 against her head.

	Kate's eyes are wide with fear.

	Seth stands, .45 in hand, ready to fire if the wrong person
	should open the door.

	Everybody talks low and quiet.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		This isn't gonna work.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Shut up. It's gonna work just fine,

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		I just want to go on record as saying
		this is a bad idea.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Duly noted. Now, shut up.

	Everyone's quiet for a second, till Richard breaks it.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>			(to himself)
		They're gonna search the van.

<b>				SETH
</b>			(offhand)
		As long as you don't act like a
		fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		What does that mean?

<b>				SETH
</b>			(distracted)
		What?

	Richard lets Kate go, she quickly moves to the side.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		You just called me a fuckin' nut.

<b>				SETH
</b>		No, I didn't.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		Yes, you did. You said as long as I
		don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying
		that I've been acting like a fuckin'
		nut.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Take a pill, kid. I just meant stay
		cool.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		You meant that, but you meant the
		other, too.

	Kate can't believe what she's watching. Neither can Seth.

<b>				SETH
</b>			(serious as a heart attack)
		This ain't the time, Richard.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>			(his voice rising)
		Fuck those spic pigs! You called me a
		fuckin' nut, and where I come from,
		that stops the train on its tracks.

<b>				SETH
</b>			(real quiet and violent)
		Keep your voice down.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>			(quiet back)
		Or what?

<b>	BACK TO JACOB AND SCOTT		
</b>
<b>				JACOB
</b>		Have you forgotten about your sister?

<b>				SCOTT
</b>		They're gonna kill us. They get us
		across the border, they're gonna take
		us out in the desert and shoot us.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		If they get over the border, they're
		gonna let us go.

<b>				SCOTT
</b>		Dad, I watch those reality shows.
		They never let anybody go. Any cop
		will tell you, in a situation like
		this, you get a chance, you go for it.
		This is our chance.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		What about Kate?

<b>				SCOTT
</b>		They're gonna kill her anyway. At
		least now with all these cops we've
		got a fighting chance.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Son, I have this situation under
		control. I know exactly what I'm
		doing. You're going to have to trust
		me on this.

<b>				SCOTT
</b>		If trusting you means trusting those
		fuckin' killers, I can't do that. If
		you don't tell the cops, I will.


	Jacob grabs Scott by the front of his shirt, and yanks him
	to him.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Now, you listen to me. You ain't gonna
		do a goddamn fucking thing, you hear
		me! Nobody cares what you think, I'm
		running this show, I make the
		decisions.

<b>				SCOTT
</b>		He's running the show.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		I'm running the show. I make the
		plays, and you back the plays I
		make. Stop thinking with your fucking
		balls. Kate in a room with a couple of
		desperate men with nothing to fucking
		lose ain't the time to "go for it."
		I need your cover. Cover my ass.

	There's a HONK behind them.

	They both look out the window. It's their turn with the
	BORDER PATROL GUARDS. JACOB takes the wheel and drives up.

	A stern BORDER GUARD approaches JACOB'S window.

<b>				BORDER GUARD
</b>		How many with you?

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Just my son and I.

<b>				BORDER GUARD
</b>		What is your purpose in Mexico?

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Vacation. I'm taking him to see his
		first bullfight.

<b>	BACK TO BATHROOM
</b>
<b>				RICHARD
</b>		I'm curious. What was the nuttiest
		thing I did?

<b>				SETH
</b>		This ain't the time.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		Oh, I know, was it possibly when your
		ass was rotting in jail and I broke it
		out? Yeah, you're right, that was
		pretty fuckin' nutty. Not to mention
		stupid. But you know what? I can fix
		that right now.

	SETH HAULS off and PUNCHES Richard smack in the head.
	Richard HITS the floor, Guard, Jacob, and Scott hear
	Richard fall in the bathroom.

<b>				BORDER GUARD
</b>		What was that?

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Oh, that's just my daughter in the
		bathroom.

<b>				BORDER GUARD
</b>		You said it was just you and your son.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		I meant me, my son and my daughter.

<b>	CLOSE-UP BORDER GUARD
</b>
<b>				BORDER GUARD
</b>		Open the door. I'm coming aboard.

<b>	BACK TO BATHROOM
</b>
<b>	CLOSE-UP KATE
</b>
	We can only see Kate's face. It's scared. We hear rustling
	around the bathroom, but we don't know what it is.

	Then it's quiet. Then we hear talking outside the door, but
	we can't make it out. Then we hear a knock.

<b>				KATE
</b>		I'm in the bathroom.

<b>				BORDER GUARD (O.S.)
</b>		It's the Border Patrol. Open up.

<b>				KATE
</b>		It's open.

	We hear the door open and see the light change on Kate's
	face. She's looking up.

	BORDER GUARD in the doorway looking in.

	HE SEES: Kate by herself, pants around her ankles, sitting
	on the toilet.

<b>				KATE
</b>		Do you mind? Shut the fucking door.

<b>				BORDER GUARD
</b>		Excuse me.

	He closes the door. Kate lets out a breath. We wait a beat,
	Seth pulls back the curtain in the shower, we see Richie on
	the floor of the shower knocked out.

	Seth and Kate meet eyes.

	He gives her the O.K. signal.

<b>								  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	BACK WINDOW MOTOR HOME
</b>
	We see through the back window of the motor home, the border
	getting smaller as we drive away from it.

	Scott knocks on the bathroom door.

<b>				SCOTT
</b>		It's clear.

	Seth BURSTS out of the bathroom.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Goddamn, that was. intense!

	Seth goes to the back window. He sees the border getting
	farther and farther away. No cars following.

<b>				SETH
</b>			(to himself)
		We did it.
			(pause)
		We're in Mexico.

	Seth throws his head back and SCREAMS for joy.

	Kate, emerging from the bathroom, reacts to Seth's scream,
	along with Scott.

	Seth is so happy that he does a little jig in the back of
	the van.

	Everybody else is still tense as shit. But Seth lets go of
	all his tension, and becomes a new man before our eyes. He
	turns to Kate.

<b>				SETH
</b>			(loud and happy)
		Come here, Kate!

	Kate, nervous, takes a step back.

	He charges for her. GRABS her, hugs her around her waist,
	and spins her around. When he lets her go, she stumbles
	dizzily onto the bed.

<b>				SETH
</b>			(to Kate)
		You were magnificent! You told him to
		shut the fucking door. I'm hiding in
		the shower, and I'm thinking to
		myself, "Did I just fuckin' hear what
		I just fuckin' heard? And what does he
		do -- he shuts the fucking door!

	Kate kind of half smiles.

<b>				SETH
</b>		If I was a bit younger, baby, I'd
		fuckin' marry you!

	Seth goes up front and slaps Jacob on the back.

<b>				SETH
</b>		I gotta hand it to ya, Pops, you
		raised a fuckin' woman.

	Jacob doesn't share Seth's enthusiasm, but he is relieved.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		We did our part, we gotcha in Mexico.
		Now it's time for your part, letting
		us go.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Pops, when you're right, you're right,
		and you are right.

<b>				KATE
</b>			(suddenly brightens)
		You're gonna let us go?

<b>				SETH
</b>		In the morning, darlin', in the
		morning, we are G-O-N-E and you are
		F-R-E-E. Now, I know I put you guys
		through hell, and I know I've been one
		rough pecker, but from here on end you
		guys are in my cool book. Scotty, help
		me pick Richie up, and lay him down.
		Jacob, keep going on this road till
		you get to a sign that says, "Digayo."
		When you get to Digayo, turn this big
		bastard left, go on down for a few
		miles, then you see a bar called "The
		Titty Twister." From what I hear, you
		can't miss it.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Then?

<b>				SETH
</b>		Then stop, 'cause that's where we're
		going.

	He slaps him once again on the back, and leaves to attend
	to Richard.

<b>								  CUT TO:
</b>
	CLOSE-UP RICHARD without glasses. Unconscious, Seth slaps
	his face.

<b>				SETH (O.S.)
</b>		 C'mon, kid, wake up. Don't make a
		 career out of it.

	Richard starts coming to and opens his eyes. Seth sits at the
	foot of the bed.

<b>				SETH
</b>		You okay?

<b>				RICHARD
</b>			(disoriented)
		Yeah, I think so. What happened?

<b>				SETH
</b>		I don't know, you just passed out.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		I did?

<b>				SETH
</b>		Yeah, we were just standing there. You
		said something about your shoulder
		hurting, then you just hit the ground
		like a sack of potatoes.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		Really?

<b>				SETH
</b>		Yeah, when you fell your head smacked
		the toilet hard. It scared the shit
		outta me. Sure you're okay?

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little
		fucked up.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Well, let me tell ya something, gonna
		clear your head right up. We are
		officially Mexicans.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		What?

<b>				SETH
</b>		We are...
			(singing)
		"South of the border down Mexico way."

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		We are?

<b>				SETH
</b>		Yep. We're heading for the rendezvous
		right now. We get there, we pound
		booze till Carlos shows up, he escorts
		us to El Ray. And then me and you,
		brother, kick fuckin' back. How ya
		like them apples?

	Slowly shaking the cobwebs out of his head.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		Far out.
			(pause)
		Where are my glasses?

<b>				SETH
</b>		They broke when you fell.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!

<b>				SETH
</b>		Don't worry about it, we'll get you
		some glasses.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		What dya mean, don't worry about it.
		Of course I'm gonna worry about it,
		I can't fuckin' see.

<b>				SETH
</b>		When we get to El Ray, I'll take care
		of it.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		Yeah, like a Mexican
		hole-in-the-wall's gonna have my
		fuckin' prescription.

<b>				SETH
</b>		It's not a big deal, unless you make
		it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy,
		Richie, stop bringing me down with
		bullshit.

	Jacob calls to the back.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Guys! We're here.

<b>								  CUT TO:
</b>
	A neon sign that flashes:

<b>		THE TITTY TWISTER
</b>		 Hiker/Trucker bar, Dusk till Dawn

	Underneath the joint's proud name on the sign, and
	on top of "Biker/Trucker bar, Dusk till Dawn" is a
	well-endowed woman, whose breast is being twisted
	by a neon hand.


<b>	EXT. THE TITTY TWISTER NIGHT
</b>	The neon sign sits on top of the rudest, sleaziest, most
	crab-infested, strip joint, honky-tonk whorehouse in all of
	Mexico.

	The Titty Twister is located out in the middle of
	nowheres ville. It sits by itself with nothing around it for
	miles. A plethora of choppers and eighteen wheelers are
	parked out in front. The walls almost pulsate from the LOUD,
	RAUNCHY MUSIC within the structure. Signs cover the walls
	outside reading things like: 

<b>	"NUDE DANCING", "WHORES", "BEER", "AUTHENTIC MEXICAN FOOD",
</b><b>	"BIKERS AND TRUCKERS ONLY", "OPEN DUSK TILL DAWN",
</b><b>	"THURSDAY COCKFIGHT NIGHT", "WEDNESDAY DOGFIGHT NIGHT",
</b><b>	"DONKEY SHOW MONDAYS", "EVERY FRIDAY BARE KNUCKLE FIGHT TO
</b><b>	THE DEATH, FEATURING THE LOVELY SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM",
</b>	"ATHENA AND DANNY THE WONDER PONY", and "THE SLEAZY TITTY
<b>	TWISTER DANCERS."
</b>
	In the parking lot, a BIKER and a TRUCK DRIVER beat the shit
	out of each other, one with a pipe, the other with a hammer.
	A SECOND BIKER fucks a Titty Twister WHORE against the wall.
	A greasy man, known as CHET PUSSY, stands in the parking
	lot, soliciting customers through a Mr. Microphone.

<b>				CHET
</b>		Pussy, pussy, pussy! All pussy must
		go. At the Titty Twister we're
		slashing pussy in half! This is a
		pussy blow out! Make us an offer on our
		vast selection of pussy! We got white
		pussy, black pussy, Spanish pussy,
		yellow pussy, hot pussy, cold pussy,
		wet pussy, tight pussy, big pussy,
		bloody pussy, fat pussy, hairy pussy,
		smelly pussy, velvet pussy, silk
		pussy, Naugahyde pussy, snappin'
		pussy, horse pussy, dog pussy, mule
		pussy, fake pussy! If we don't have
		it, you don't want it!

	The Fullers' recreational vehicle pulls into the parking
	lot and stops.


<b>	INT. MOTOR HOME - NIGHT
</b>
	What's left of the Fuller family and the Gecko family look
	out the windshield onto the sight that is the Titty Twister.

<b>				SETH
</b>			(to the group)
		Okay, troops, this is the homestretch.
		Here's the deal; this place closes at
		dawn. Carlos is gonna meet us here
		sometime before dawn. Which by my
		guesstimate is somewhere between three
		or four hours from now. So we're gonna
		go in there, take a seat, have a drink
		-- have a bunch of drinks, and wait
		for Carlos. That could be an hour,
		that could be three hours, I don't
		know which. But when he gets here,
		me and Richie are going to leave
		with him. After we split, you guys
		are officially out of this stewpot.
		Let me just say I'm real happy about
		where we're at. We got a real nice, "I
		don't fuck with you -- you don't fuck
		with me" attitude going on. Now, if
		everybody just keeps playin' it cool
		-- and I'm talking to you, too, Richie
		-- everybody's gonna get what they
		want. Comprende, amigos?

	Everybody nods and mutters in agreement.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Okay hard drinkers, let's drink hard.
		I'm buyin'.


<b>	EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
</b>	The camper door FLIES OPEN and the two brothers and the
	Fuller family step out into the night.

	They look across the parking lot at the Titty Twister.
	It literally looks in some ways like the entrance to hell.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Out of the stew pot and into the fire.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Shit, I been to bars make this place
		look like a fuckin' 4-H club.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		I gotta say I'm with Jacob on this. I
		been to some fucked up places in my
		time, but that place is fucked up.

	Seth can't believe it.

<b>				SETH
</b>			(in a baby talk voice)
		Aww-w, whatsa matter, is the little
		baby too afraid to go into the big
		scary bar?

	The two brothers square off, not like strangers fighting,
	but like brothers fight. They talk real quiet, but real
	personal.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		That's what you think?

<b>				SETH
</b>		That's how you're lookin', Richie.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		I'm lookin' scared?

<b>				SETH
</b>		That's what you look like.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		You know what you look like?

<b>				SETH
</b>		No, Richie, what do I look like?

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		You're lookin' green.

	That's not what Seth expected to hear.

<b>				SETH
</b>		How?

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		Where are you right now?

<b>				SETH
</b>		What do you mean?

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		Where are you?

<b>				SETH
</b>		I'm here with you.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		No, you're not. You're sippin'
		margaritas in El Ray. But we're
		not in El Ray. We're here --
		getting ready to go in there.
		You're so pleased with yourself
		about getting into Mexico, you
		think the job's down. It ain't.
		Get back on the clock. That's a
		fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around
		there for a coupla hours, in all
		likelihood, we'll get fucked with.
		So get your shit together, brother.

<b>				SETH
</b>		My shit is together.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		It don't look together.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Well, it is. Just because I'm happy
		doesn't mean I'm on vacation. You're
		just not used to seein' me happy,
		'cause it's been about fifteen fuckin'
		years since I been happy. But my shit
		is forever together.

	Richard believes Seth's response.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		Okay, just checkin'.

	They walk toward the bar's entrance. Chet Pussy talks into
	the microphone.

<b>				CHET
</b>			(yelling into the microphone)
		Take advantage of our penny pussy sale.
		Buy any piece of pussy a tour regular
		price, you get another piece of pussy,
		of equal or lesser value, for a penny.
		Now try and beat pussy for a penny!
		If you can find cheaper pussy
		anywhere, fuck it!

	Chet notices our heroes, especially young Kate.

<b>				CHET
</b>			(in microphone, towards Kate)
		What's this? A new flavor approaching.
		Apple Pie Pussy.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Step aside, asshole.

	Chet POKES HIS FINGER in Seth's CHEST.

<b>				CHET
</b>		Not so fast, Slick.

	Seth GRABS HOLD of Chet's FINGER, BENDS it BACKWARDS till
	the BONE SNAPS in two.

	Chet lets out a SCREAM.

	Seth VIOLENTLY brings his HEAD FORWARD PULVERIZING Chet's
<b>	NOSE.
</b>
	Chet FALLS to his KNEES in front of Seth.

	Seth HOOKS him with a powerful FIST UNDER his CHIN that
	SNAPS Chet's HEAD BACK, and THROWS him on his BACK.

	After HITTING the GROUND, Seth SENDS a SAVAGE KICK straight
	to Chet's FACE, ROLLING HIM OVER.

	Chet is OUT.

	The whole altercation took two seconds.

	Everyone's in shock and looks at Seth. Seth looks back at
	everyone.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Now, is my shit together, or is my
		shit together?

	Richard and Seth laugh with each other.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>			(slappin' Seth five)
		Your shit is forever together!

	They head for the door. Richard stays behind for a second,
	and gives the fallen Chet a few, swift kicks,


<b>	INT. THE TITTY TWISTER NIGHT
</b>
	If the Titty Twister looked like the asshole of the world
	from the outside, in the immortal words of Al Jolson, "You
	ain't seen nothin' yet." This is the kind of place where
	they sweep up the teeth and hose down the cum, the blood
	and the beer at closing.

	In the back, TOPLESS DANCERS do lap dances with customers,
	while a SLEAZY SEXY STRIPPER STRIPS to RAUNCHY MUSIC, played
	at ear drum-bursting level. TWO MEN are in a savage
	BAREKNUCKLE FIGHT, surrounded by screaming customers of
	bikers and truckers.

	One of the dancers is a man with a saddle on his back, his
	name is DANNY THE WONDER PONY. The woman on his back, in
	the saddle, feet in the stirrups, hands on the reins, is
	ATHENA, his rider. They dance around to the cheers of the
	crowd.

	Bikers and truckers play pool in the back. Fights break out
	here about one every ten minutes. The customers may start 'em,
	but the bouncer, BIG EMILIO, ends 'em.

	Seth, Richard, Jacob, Scott and Kate walk through the door.
	They each individually take in the sights and the smells.
	Seth is the first to say something.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Now this is my kinda place! I could
		become a regular.

	The man behind the bar is RAZOR CHARLIE. He eyes the group
	as they approach.

	Their difference from the usual road waif nomads who
	populate the Twister disturbs him. He exchanges a knowing
	look across the room with Big Emilio, as the group bellies
	up to the bar.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Whiskey!

<b>				RAZOR CHARLIE
</b>			(in English)
		You can't come in here.

<b>				SETH
</b>		What dya mean?

<b>				RAZOR CHARLIE
</b>		This is a private club. You're not
		welcome.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough
		to drink here?

<b>				RAZOR CHARLIE
</b>		This bar is for bikers and truckers
		only.
			(points his finger to Seth)
		You, get out!

	Big Emilio almost magically appears behind Seth and places 
	HIS BIG BEEFY SAUSAGE-FINGERED HAND HARD on Seth's shoulder.

<b>				BIG EMILIO
</b>			(to Seth in Spanish)
		Walk, Pendaho.

	Seth slowly turns his eyes to the big hand on his shoulder.

<b>				SETH
</b>			(low)
		Take your hand off me.

<b>				BIG EMILIO
</b>			(Spanish)
		I'm going to count to three.

<b>				SETH
</b>		No, I'm going to count to three.

<b>				BIG EMILIO
</b>		Uno...

<b>				SETH
</b>		Two..

	Jacob jumps in the middle.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Now wait a minute, there's no reason
		to get ugly. There's just a
		misunderstanding going on here. You
		said this bar is for truckers and
		bikers, Well, I'm a truck driver.

	Everybody looks at Jacob.

	As Jacob talks he takes out his wallet.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		If you look outside your door, parked
		in your parking lot, you'll see a big
		ass recreational vehicle. That's mine.
		In order to drive that legally, you
		need a class two driver's license.
		That is the same license that the
		DMV requires truck drivers to carry
		in order to drive a truck.
			(he takes the license out
			 of his wallet and lays it
			 on the bar)
		That is me, and this is my class two
		license. This is a truck driver's bar,
		I am a truck driver, and these are
		my friends.

	Everybody's a little stunned after Jacob's speech.

	Razor Charlie picks up the license, looks at Jacob, looks at
	everyone in the party and smiles.

<b>				RAZOR CHARLIE
</b>			(to Jacob)
		Welcome to the Titty Twister. What
		can I get you?

	Seth BRUSHES OFF Big Emilio's paw.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Bottle of whiskey and five glasses.

	Razor Charlie's eyes go to Seth. Even though he has a big
	smile on his face, he looks like he's going to kill Seth.
	But instead he just says,

<b>				RAZOR CHARLIE
</b>		Coming right up.

	Razor Charlie goes for the bottle. Big Emilio gives the
	party one last look and walks away. Richard gives Jacob a
	buddy punch on the shoulder.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		Good job, Pops.

	Seth's still frying an egg on his head.

<b>				SETH
</b>		That's just fuckin' typical. Biggest
		number one problem with Mexico, it's
		not service oriented. I was feelin'
		so good, and those fuckin' spies
		brought me down.

	Richard puts his arm around Seth.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		Fuck 'em, shake it off.

	Razor Charlie brings the bottle and the glasses. Seth looks
	at the guy, still pissed.

<b>				SETH
</b>		You serve food, Jose?

	Razor Charlie knows Seth's taunting him with a racial slur,
	but he just smiles and says,

<b>				RAZOR CHARLIE
</b>		Best in Mexico.

<b>				SETH
</b>		I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a
		table, send over a waitress to take
		our order.

	Seth walks away, and the group follows him.

	We just hang on the evil wheels turning inside of Razor
	Charlie's head.

	The five of them move across the floor to a table. As they
	walk, Kate attracts stares, wolf whistles and rude comments
	from some of the patrons. Jacob keeps near his daughter.

	The dancers do their sexy routines. A big-chested,
	wild-haired blonde catches Scott's eye. She winks at him.

	Richard leans over and whispers in Scott's ear.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		Anytime you want a lap dance with that
		broad, say the word. It's on me, kiddo.

	He gives the boy's neck a squeeze. Jacob's eyes survey the
	surroundings. Big Emilio and Razor Charlie quietly exchange
	words about the party in Spanish.

<b>				RAZOR CHARLIE
</b>			(in Spanish)
		They're not the normal road trash we
		normally feed on. But it'll be okay.
		No one knows they're here.

	The five of them find a table and sit down.

	Seth, still in a bad mood, takes the cork out of the whiskey
	bottle and tosses it. He pours Richie and himself a glass.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Who else?

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Pass.

<b>				SETH
</b>			(picking a fight)
		Why not, against your religion?

<b>				JACOB
</b>			(won't be baited)
		No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking
		now.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Suit yourself, more for me.
			(to Scott)
		Scotty?

	Scott shakes his head no.

<b>				SETH
</b>			(to Kate)
		How 'bout you?
			(pointing at Scott and Kate)
		are safer in here with us than
		wandering around a Mexican border town
		all night long. Just don't do nothin'
		stupid and we'll all get along fine.
			(to Scott)
		Scotty, you sure you don't want a
		drink?

<b>				SCOTT
</b>		Okay, I'll have one.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		No you won't.

	Seth pours Scott a shot.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Sorry, Pops, but I'm drinkin' and I
		don't like drinkin' alone. Bottoms
		up, boy.

	Scott takes the drink and he, too, experiences an
	on-drinker's tremor.

	Seth turns to Kate.

<b>				SETH
</b>		How about you, cutie pie? Ready for
		round two?

<b>				KATE
</b>		Okay.

	Seth just passes her the bottle. She pours her own shot and
	knocks it back.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>			(to Seth)
		Hey, Dr. Frankenstein, I think you
		just created a monster.

	Jacob turns to Seth and asks quietly.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Why are you so agitated?

<b>				SETH
</b>		I'm still stewing about that ape
		laying hands on me. And that fuckin'
		bartender sticks a weed up my ass,
		too.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		He backed down.

<b>				SETH
</b>		He's smilin' at us. But behind his
		smile, he's sayin', "Fuck you Jack."
		I hear that loud and clear.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		What are you going to do?

<b>				SETH
</b>			(picking up the whiskey bottle)
		I'm gonna just sit here and drain
		this bottle. And when I've drunk the
		last drop, if I still feel then, the
		way I feel now, I'm gonna take this
		bottle and break it over his melon
		head.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Before we stepped in here, you told
		all of us to be cool. That means you,
		too.

<b>				SETH
</b>			(tossing it off)
		I never said do what I do, I said do
		what I say.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Are you so much a fucking loser, you
		can't tell when you've won?

	Richard, Kate and Scott both turn to Jacob. Nobody can
	believe what he just said. Neither can Seth who calmly lays
	down his drinking glass.

<b>				SETH
</b>		What did you call me?

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Nothing. I didn't make a statement. I
		asked a question. Would you like me to
		ask it again? Very well. Are you such
		a loser you can't tell when you've
		won?
			(pause)
		The entire state of Texas, along with
		the FBI, is looking for you. Did they
		find you? No. They couldn't. They had
		every entrance to the border covered.
		There's no way you could get across.
		Did you? Yes, you did. You've won,
		Seth, enjoy it.

	Seth looks at Jacob, then picks up the bottle.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Jacob, I want you to have a drink with
		me. I insist.

	Jacob slides his empty glass over to Seth. Seth pours booze
	in Jacob's glass and his own. Both men pick up the glasses.

<b>				SETH
</b>		To your family.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		To yours.

	They both knock 'em back and slap the empty glasses down.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Now, is your shit together?

<b>				SETH
</b>		Forever together.

	Seth turns to Scott.

<b>				SETH
</b>		In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take
		it that's yours.

<b>				SCOTT
</b>		Yeah, it's mine.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Go out and bring it in. I feel a song coming on.

<b>								  CUT TO:
</b>
	Seth sitting at the table, playing guitar, singing Mexican
	songs. Some bikers, truckers, and whores have gathered
	around their table. Everyone's groovin'. Seth finishes the
	song. Everybody applauds.

	Razor Charlie behind the bar grabs the greasy microphone
	that he uses to announce dancers.

<b>				RAZOR CHARLIE
</b>			(announcer voice in Spanish)
		And now for your viewing pleasure. The
		Mistress of the Macabre. The Epitome
		of Evil. The most sinister woman to
		dance on the face of the earth. Lowly
		dogs, get on your knees, bow your
		heads and worship at the feet of
<b>		SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM!
</b>
	The lights go down low. A light hits the stage. The opening
	notes of the Coaster's "Down in Mexico" fills the room.

	The crowd hushes up.

	And on the stage steps SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM.

	This Mexican goddess is beautiful, but not the beauty that
	Stendhal described in "As the Promise of Happiness," but
	the beauty of the siren who lures men to their doom.

	She dances to the raunchy music, not like she owned the
	stage, but like she owned the world.

	And if the patrons of the Titty Twister are her world, the
	world is proud to be her possession.

	All activity in the bar, save Santanico, stops. Even the
	Fuller/Gecko table falls under her spell. Especially
	Richard, Scott and Kate. Seth knows this song and
	accompanies from the table with the guitar.

	When the music builds to its explosive section.

	Santanico LEAPS from the stage, LANDING in the middle of the
	room.

	She does an eyes-closed voodoo dance in perfect step with
	the beat. As the music continues to play, a very fucked-up
	looking Chet Pussy walks in. He goes over to Razor Charlie
	and points at Seth's table, describing what happened.

	As the last verse plays, Santanico, like a snake, comes up
	from the ground, on top of the Fuller/Gecko table.

	Richard, Kate and Scott are enraptured.

	Santanico scans the table, zeroing in on our boy Richard.
	She STANDS OVER him.

	While moving her body to the music, she lifts up the whisky
	bottle from the table, and pours the whiskey down her leg.

	She lifts up her foot, with the whiskey dripping from her
	toes, and sticks it in Richard's face.

<b>				SANTANICO
</b>			(to Richard in Spanish)
		Drink up.

	Richie, mesmerized, sucks the whiskey off her toes. The
	CROWD GOES WILD. Santanico smiles, master of all she
	surveys.

	Jacob and Scott are embarrassed.

	Kate, oddly enough, is turned on by the controlling power
	this woman has over a man she's deathly feared.

	Seth laughs out loud a Mexican "yi yi yiii" laugh, keeping
	the beat with his guitar.

	Across the room, Razor Charlie, Chet by his side, motions
	over Big Emilio. He begins explaining with pointing what
	Seth and company did to Chet.

	Richard continues to suck her toes.

	The song ends, Santanico extracts her foot from Richard's
	mouth. Steps off the table. Takes a drink of whiskey. Looks
	down at the seated Richard.

	She GRABS the back of his hair, YANKS his head BACK. His
	mouth OPENS because she's hurting him. She LEANS her FACE
	OVER his like she's going to kiss him. Then let's the whiskey
	from her mouth fall into his. They never touch. The crowd
	applauds. She lets go of Richard's hair. Except for Jacob
	and Richard, both for their own reasons, the table applauds,
	none louder than Seth.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Now that's what
		I call a fuckin' show!

	One of Santanico's FLUNKIES brings the naked woman a robe,
	which she puts on.

	Richard, still in a daze, looks up at his new friend.

<b>				SETH
</b>			(snapping his fingers)
		Earth to Richie. Don't you wanna ask
		your new friend to join us?

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		Yeah.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Well, then ask her, dumb ass.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>			(looking up at Santanico)
		Por favor, Senorita. Would you care to
		join us?

<b>				SANTANICO
</b>			(to Richard)
		Muy bien, gracias.

	Santanico sits down next to Richie. Seth pours her a drink.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Richie, you lucky bastard!
			(to Santanico)
		Now, little lady, you could of just as
		easily done that to me. Who a Nelly!
		You got my dick harder 'n Chinese
		arithmetic.

	The table laughs.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Which reminds me of a joke. Little Red
		Riding Hood is walking through the
		forest and she comes across Little Bo
		Peep, and Little Bo Peep says:
		"Little Red Riding Hood, are you
		crazy? Don't you know the Big Bad Wolf
		is walking these woods and if he finds
		you he's gonna pull down your dress
		and squeeze your titties?" Then Little
		Red Riding Hood hitches up her skirt
		and taps a .357 Magnum she has
		holstered on her thigh and says: "No
		he won't."

	As Seth tells his joke, Jacob notices Razor Charlie, Big
	Emilio and Chet moving rapidly towards their table.

<b>				JACOB
</b>			(to himself)
		Oh, shit.
			(to Seth)
		Seth --

	Seth waves him away.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Not now. So finally she comes across
		the Big Bad Wolf and the Big Bad
		Wolf's laughing and says: "Little Red
		Riding Hood, you know better than to
		be walking around these woods alone.
		You know I'm just gonna have to pull
		down your dress and squeeze your
		titties." Then Little Red Riding Hood
		whips out her .357, cocks it, sticks
		it in the Big Bad Wolf's face and
		says: "No you won't. You're gonna eat
		me, just like the story says."

	Seth starts laughing at his own joke uproariously. Richard,
	Kate, Scott and Santanico join in too. Before Jacob can say
	anything --

	The Titty Twister trio stand over the table.

<b>				RAZOR CHARLIE
</b>			(to Chet in Spanish)
		Which one?

<b>				CHET
</b>			(pointing at Seth)
		This piece of shit broke my finger
		and my nose...
			(pointing at Richard)
		then this fag kicked me in the ribs
		while I was down.

	That's all Big Emilio has to hear.

<b>				BIG EMILIO
</b>			(to The Gecko Brothers)
		Up!

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		Fuck off, ape man!

	Big Emilio leans in with his beefy hand, GRABS Richard by
	the shoulder. Richard lets out a howl as blood pours from
	his wounded shoulder.

	Santanico steps back from the table.

	Seth jumps to his feet and FIRES a round from his .45 into
	Big Emilio, sending his bullet-ridden body to the floor.
	Razor Charlie whips out a straight version of his name sake
	and SLASHES Seth across the face.

	Seth SCREAMS at the top of his lungs as his hand goes up to
	his laid open cheek.

	Richard, who has fallen to the ground holding his wound,
	brings up his .45 and starts BLASTING.

	Razor Charlie takes a bullet in the head, chest and belly
	before he hits the floor.

	Jacob and his children have hit the floor as well to stay
	out of gunfire.

	The bikers, truckers, waitresses and whores all stop what
	they were doing.

	The music continues to play, though the dancers stop
	dancing.

	Santanico, who's closest to the two brothers, smells
	something.

	Her NOSTRILS FLARE.

	Richard moves to his brother, who takes out a handkerchief
	and puts it to his face.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		How are you?

<b>				SETH
</b>		Scarred for life, that's how I am!

	Seth looks up and sees Chet still standing there.

<b>				SETH
</b>		You thought it was pretty funny,
		didn't you?

	Both brothers FIRE on Chet. Chet's blown left... right...
	left... right... then drops, pointing their guns towards
	the crowd.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Everybody be cool, or you'll be just
		as dead as these fucks!

	SLOW MOTION: Blood drips down the side of Seth's face.

	SLOW MOTION: It splatters to the floor.

	The CAMERA scans the crowd. The patrons are scared, but the
	waitresses, whores and dancers lick their lips.

	SLOW MOTION: Blood drips from Richard's shoulder. It falls
	to the floor, splattering.

	WE MOVE INTO SANTANICO'S FACE. A special aroma fills
	her nostrils. Her eyes lock on Richard. The look on her face
	could easily be read as intense sexual desire.

<b>	CLOSE-UP KATE ON FLOOR
</b>
	Looks up and watches, eyes wide with fear, Santanico's
	transformation.

	Her NOSE RECEDES INTO her face like a rodent's. The whites
	of her eyes turn YELLOW. The FANGS of a beast PROTRUDE from
	her mouth. Kate yells from the floor.

<b>				KATE
</b>			(yelling)
		Richie, look out!

	Before Richie can turn around.

	SANTANICO LEAPS ACROSS THE FLOOR, LANDS on his BACK and
	SINKS her FANGS into Richie's wounded SHOULDER.

	Richard LETS LOOSE with an agonizing SCREAM.

	Seth turns to his brother's cry.

	He sees SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM, like a mongoose attached to
	a cobra, legs wrapped around Richard's waist, fangs buried
	deep in his shoulder, and Richard screaming and slamming
	about, trying to knock her off.

	Richard screams to Seth:

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		Shoot her! Shoot her! Get her off!

	Seth tries to aim his gun, but there's too much movement. He
	can't get a clear shot.

	Jacob and his children can't believe what they're seeing.

	Richard can't take it anymore, his knees buckle. Santanico
	rides him down to the floor.

	Seth gets a clear shot, he takes aim and FIRES, hitting the
	vamp in the head, blowing her off his brother.

	Richard, who's on all fours, tries to stand and gets about
	half way before he stops, saying:

<b>				RICHARD
</b>			(with his dying breath)
		Fucking Bitch!

	He tumbles over, a corpse.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Richie.

	Suddenly, the eyes of Big Emilio, Razor Charlie and Chet
	Pussy pop open. The "dead" men sit up with evil grins on
	their faces.

	The patrons scream.

	A WHORE locks the front door (which is a complicated lock
	with steel rods going into the ground), turns toward the bar
	and yells:

<b>				WHORE
</b>		Dinner is served!

	The bikers and truckers who have been transfixed, watching
	the impossible, realize that the waitresses, naked dancers
	and whores who they were pawing just five minutes ago, have
	turned into yellow-eyed, razor-fanged, drool-dripping
<b>	VAMPIRES.
</b>
	The vamps attack.

	What follows is a shark feeding frenzy. Whores, who had been
	sitting on customer's laps, sink their teeth into unshaven
	necks.

	Naked strippers and bikers wail the shit out of each other.
	Truckers get their heads caved in by women half their size.
	The patrons use what ever they can find to fend off the
	monsters: chairs, chair legs, broken bottles, switchblades,
	anything.

	Jacob, Kate and Scott make a dash and dive behind the bar.
	They hide and watch.

	Seth stands where his was, limp dick of a .45 in his hand,
	too freaked, scared and stunned to do anything. He stands
	motionless, watching what he can't believe.

	Behind him, Santanico, who lies next to the dead Richard,
	eyes POP OPEN.

	She RISES in her snake/dance way.

	Seth feels her and SPINS in her direction, gun raised.

<b>				SANTANICO
</b>		Let's see if you taste as good as your
		brother.

	She approaches Seth, who FIRES at her. BAM... BAM... BAM...
	CLICK... CLICK... CLICK... CLICK. She laughs and gives her
	hair a toss back. Seth, moving backwards, is terrified.

	Santanico gives Seth a SWINGING ROUND HOUSE PUNCH to the
	JAW, that sends him FLYING over a table, SLIDING ACROSS the
	FLOOR and INTO the WALL.

	A bad-ass biker named FROST, with a hideous burn on the
	side of his face, stands on top of a pool table, swinging a
	pool cue, left to right, fending off vamps.

	Big Emilio picks up a biker who stabbed him with a
	switchblade and throws the poor bastard from one end of the
	bar to the other.

	The biker-winner of the bare knuckle fight, SEX MACHINE,
	goes head to head with a stripper.

	The vamp might have superhuman strength, but Sex Machine has
	close to superhuman strength, and he's matching the
	vamp bitch blow for blow.

	Then he GRABS her by the waist, LIFTS her up over his head
	and BRINGS her DOWN HARD on an upturned table, IMPALING her
	on the wooden leg.

	FROST is still swinging his POOL CUE, when Razor Charlie
	appears, straight razor in hand.

	Frost JUMPS off the table to meet the challenge. Razor
	Charlie SWINGS at him, Frost LEAPS back, SWINGING his pool
	cue at him. They do this dance, till Frost CRACKS Charlie
	UPSIDE the HEAD with the pool cue, breaking it in half.
	Charlie FEELS the HIT. Frost PLUNGES the splintered end of
	the cue in Razor Charlie's heart.

	Green blood comes out of his chest, as Charlie screams the
	vampire's death scream.

	Seth comes to and finds Santanico standing over him. He
	tries to rise, but Santanico places her bare foot on his
	chest, pinning him down to the floor. He tries to move, but
	the pressure of her foot is equivalent to an engine block
	placed on his chest.

<b>				SANTANICO
</b>		I'm not gonna drain you completely.
		You're gonna turn for me, You'll be
		my slave. You'll live for me. You'll
		eat bugs because I order it. Because
		I don't think you're worthy of human
		blood, you'll feed on the blood of
		stray dogs. You'll be my foot stool.
		And at my command, you'll lick the dog
		shit from my boot heel. Since you'll
		be my dog, your new name will be
		"Spot". Welcome to slavery.

	SLOW MOTION: A WHISKEY BOTTLE FLIES THROUGH the AIR, sailing
		 end over end.

<b>	CLOSE-UP SANTANICO
</b>
	looking down at Seth, her face contorts to FEED MODE, when
	the bottle HITS her SQUARE in the HEAD, SHATTERING.

	We see that Jacob behind the bar threw it.

	Santanico, bathed in whiskey and broken glass, is
	momentarily dazed. She looks down at Seth.

	Seth sits up, .45 in hand, and fires.

	Santanico is HIT in the CHEST. The bullet from the gun makes
	the liquor-soaked robe ignite.

	Santanico SCREAMS as she GOES UP IN FLAMES.

	Big Emilio sees Santanico's fiery death. He lets out a cry.

<b>				BIG EMILIO
</b>		Noooooo!

	He turns his hateful gaze on the two humans.

	Seth and Jacob see Big Emilio zeroing in on them, then they
	see him move his big frame in their direction. Seth turns to
	Jacob.

<b>				SETH
</b>		We may be in trouble.

	Big Emilio walks steadily through the bar like Godzilla
	walks through Tokyo. Tipping over tables, knocking fighting
	vamps and humans alike on their asses on his way to stamp
	out Seth and Jacob. A TRUCKER JUMPS in his path to attack
	him, with a QUICK SWING of his hand the trucker is brushed
	aside, receiving a broken neck for the effort.

	Big Emilio never breaks his stride or takes his eyes off
	Seth and Jacob.

	Seth and Jacob both grab pieces of wood, holding it like a
	weapon, but the wood looks puny compared to their opponent.

	Big Emilio stands in front of them. The two men hold their
	wood tight. Fangs grow in Big Emilio's mouth that make him
	look like a huge walking shark.

	Just when Big Emilio's ready to strike, he hears behind him,

<b>				VOICE (O.S.)
</b>		Hey, you, monkey man!

	Big Emilio turns and sees Sex Machine across the room.

<b>				SEX MACHINE
</b>		Anything you gotta say to them, say
		to me first.

	Both Seth and Jacob ATTACK Big Emilio from behind. He
	effortlessly knocks them away.

	They both hit the ground.

	Sex Machine gestures with his hand to Big Emilio to "come
	ahead."

	Big Emilio CHARGES towards Sex Machine, like a runaway
	locomotive.

	Sex Machine stands his ground waiting for IMPACT. The two
	huge men COLLIDE. What follows is literally a war of the
	Gargantuans. The two mastiffs POUND each other till one
	buckles. Finally, the one who buckles first is Big Emilio,
	who HITS the floor.

	Once on the floor, Seth and Jacob, stand over the huge vamp,
	BEATING him with clubs and pipes, like L.A.'s finest. The
	vamp can do nothing except SQUIRM on the floor from the
	savage beating.

<b>				SEX MACHINE
</b>		That's enough.

	Jacob and Seth stop.

	Sex Machine holds a pool cue in his hand. He SNAPS off the
	end tip, making it jagged, and like a spear, STICKS it into
	big vamp's fallen body. Big Emilio, SCREAMS, TWITCHES and
	dies. The pool cue sticks out straight up from the dead
	vamp.

	Chet Pussy spies Ms. Apple Pie Pussy herself, Kate. He
	breaks into a lecherous grin and licks the blood from
	around his mouth.

	Kate and Scott are cowering behind the bar when Chet appears
	over the top. They both let out a scream. Scott goes to
	protect his sister and receives a punch in the face for his
	trouble. Chet dives at Kate.

<b>				CHET
</b>		You know what everybody says about me?
		I suck!

	Chet goes to bite Kate, grabbing at her t-shirt, and sees
	her crucifix. HE recoils backwards. Scott grabs hold of
	his head from behind. Kate jumps up from the floor, rips
	off her cross and grabs Chet by his beatnik beard, opening
	his mouth. She SHOVES the cross inside. Chet's eyes roll
	up back into his head. Scott SLAPS Chet hard on the back.

<b>	GULP.
</b>
	Chet has swallowed the crucifix. A SIZZLING sound is heard
	moving down from his throat to his belly. He opens his
	mouth and lets out a noise similar to a train whistle. He
	jumps up from behind the bar, doing a wild dance from pain.
	He jumps from wall to wall and floor to ceiling, screaming
	all the while.

	Kate and Scott watch him from the bar, mischievous grins on
	their faces.

	Chet is on his knees, arms stretched out, yelling at the top
	of his lungs like a vamp King Lear.

<b>				CHET
</b><b>		I-AM-IN-AGONNNYYYY!
</b>
	Chet breaks off a chair leg, muttering to himself.

<b>				CHET
</b>		Stop the pain, stop the pain, stop the
		pain, stop the pain, stop the pain...

	He plunges the stake into his own heart, but instead of the
	vampire's cry that escapes from the others upon being
	staked, Chet lets out a sigh of relief.

	By this time there are not too many people left. Most of the
	vampire have been killed by wooden stakes and most of the
	customers have been butchered or drained.

	All that's left on the vampire side are two naked dancers
	and two whores. On the human side are Seth, Jacob and his
	kids, Sex Machine and Frost. Aside from the children, who
	are hiding behind the bar, all the humans are holding
	wooden stakes.

	The four human men group together. The four female vampires
	charge, teeth exposed, snarling and dripping with blood.
	Seth, Jacob, Sex Machine and Frost raise their weapons and
	slam, almost simultaneously, the four vamps. All four
	staked bodies hit the floor.

	Kate and Scott run from behind the bar to their father's
	side.

	They all stand looking at the horrible carnage that has
	taken place. The floor is littered with dead bodies.

<b>				FROST
</b>		Ain't they supposed to burn up or
		something?

	At that moment a bright flash ERUPTS, illuminating
	everyone's face. The sound of quick burning flames fills
	the air. Everybody shields their eyes from the intense
	light, which lasts only a split second.

	It vanishes, along with the bodies of the vampires. All
	that remains is a smoldering mess of goo where the bodies
	once lay.

	They all stare at the mess for a few seconds and then RUN
	for the door. It's locked. They BANG on the door, but it's
	useless. It ain't budging, yet they all go on banging.

	Except for Seth. He never ran for the door. He walks over
	to his dead brother's body and kneels beside it.

	He takes his dead hand.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Richie, I'm sorry I fucked things up.
		You'd really like it in El Ray. We'd
		find peace there. I love you little
		brother, I'll miss ya bad.

	Seth goes to kiss his brother's lips when, RICHARD 'S EYES
	POP OPEN. They're YELLOW. Seth RAISES his head in surprise.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		I'm glad you feel that way, Seth. I
		love you, too.

	Richard GRABS Seth by the front of his shirt and pulls him
	down to him. Fangs are now exposed. Seth tries to pull away.
	He SCREAMS for the others to help. Richard PULLS Seth down
	to striking distance and opens his mouth to take the big
	bite, when Sex Machine grabs Seth from behind and YANKS him
	from Richard's grasp. Jacob, Frost and the kids have
	surrounded Richard and proceed to KICK him and STOMP his
	head. Sex Machine picks up a chair and SMASHES it against a
	wall. He picks up one of the chair legs and walks over to
	where the others are holding Richard down. Richard sees the
	wood in the biker's hand. He knows what that means. Seth
	whips out his .45 and points it at Sex Machine.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Touch my brother with that stake,
		biker, and vampires won't need to
		suck your blood, they'll be able to
		lick it up off the floor.

<b>				SEX MACHINE
</b>		He ain't your brother no more.

<b>				SETH
</b>		That's a matter of opinion, and I
		don't give a fuck about your's.

	Jacob, Frost and the kids continue to hold Richard down to
	the ground.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Don't be an idiot, he'll kill us all!

	Seth aims his gun at the group.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Shut up!

	Richard's giggling.

<b>				RICHARD
</b>		Yeah, shut up.

	Seth, still holding the outstretched gun, takes the stake
	out of Sex Machine's hand. Seth lowers the .45.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Hold him down.

	The smile evaporates from Richard's face.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Richie, here's the peace in death I
		could never give you in life.

	Seth puts the stake over Richard's heart. Using the butt of
	his .45 like a hammer, he POUNDS the stake into Richard's
	heart. Richard screams and dies. They all stand around the
	body as it BURSTS INTO FLAMES and disintegrates into goo.
	Seth breaks away from the group and walks over to the bar.
	He grabs a bottle of whiskey and starts downing it. Kate,
	of all people, walks away from the group and joins Seth at
	the bar.

<b>				KATE
</b>		Are you okay?

<b>				SETH
</b>		Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The
		world's my oyster, except for the
		fact that I just rammed a wooden
		stake in my brother's heart because
		he turned into a vampire, even
		though I don't believe in vampires.
		Aside from that unfortunate business,
		everything's hunky-dory.

<b>				KATE
</b>		I'm really sorry.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Bullshit! You hate us. If you had half
		a chance you'd feed us to them!

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Then why didn't I?

	Jacob walks over to Seth.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		I saved your life. I didn't have to,
		but I did. And I'm sorry you lost your
		brother. I'm sorry he's dead. I'm
		sorry everybody's dead. Now, if we're
		gonna get out of this we need each
		other. And we need you sober and
		thinking, not drunk and...

	As Jacob has been talking, a sound has started that has
	grown LOUDER and LOUDER. Jacob stops in mid-sentence to
	identify it.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		What the hell is that?

<b>				FROST
</b>		At first I just thought it was birds.

<b>				SEX MACHINE
</b>		No, it's more of a gnawing sound.
		Birds peck, they don't gnaw. Rats
		gnaw.

	Seth puts the bottle in his hand down.

<b>				SETH
</b>		It's bats.


<b>	EXT. TITTY TWISTER - NIGHT
</b>
	The outside of the Titty Twister is literally covered with
	hats, CLAWING, FLAPPING, GNAWING, trying like hell to get
	inside.


<b>	INT. TITTY TWISTER - NIGHT
</b>
	Everybody listens to the bats SCRATCHING and clawing all
	along the walls, the roof and at the front door. Everyone's
	scared shitless and nobody has the slightest idea what to
	do next. The door begins to crack and splinter, little
	claws poke their way through.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Give me a hand!

	Jacob runs to a table top. He grabs it and covers the area
	the bats are trying to claw through. The others grab other
	items to help secure and barricade the door.

	As the survivors are panickedly boarding up the door and
	the windows, a DEAD BIKER that the vampires fed on, pops
	open his yellow eyes. He sits up and sees all the furious
	activity. Everyone's so busy they don't notice their new
	friend. The dead biker vamp sets his sights on Kate, who's
	putting a board into place. He springs to his feet and
	POUNCES on her, just as Sex Machine turns from across the
	room in her direction.

<b>				SEX MACHINE
</b>		Watch out, girly!

	The biker vamp GRABS Kate from behind. She lets out a
	scream. The vamp holds her close to him in a bear hug, but
	she's moving around so much he can't get a clear bite. The
	others hear the scream and look toward Kate. Sex Machine,
	Big Emilio's baseball bat in hand, is halfway to the rescue.
	As the biker vamp opens his mouth to take a juicy bite out
	of Kate's shoulder, Kate RAMS her head back, hitting the
	vamp in the mouth and breaking his fangs. He releases her
	and spits out his teeth just as Sex Machine runs up and
	SWINGS the baseball bat upside the vamp's head, breaking
	the bat in two and sending the vamp to the floor. As the
	vamp lies on the floor seeing stars, Sex Machine grabs one
	of the broken ends of the bat and SHOVES it in the vamp's
	heart. He dies and bursts into flames.

	At that point, three other dead victims rise to a sitting
	position. Sex Machine grabs a chair and THROWS it to the
	ground, breaking it. He grabs the four legs.

<b>				SEX MACHINE
</b>			(mumbling to himself)
		Goddamn fuckin' vampires.

	The biker has turned into Captain Sex Machine, Vampire
	Hunter. He stakes two of the vampires as they get to their
	feet. Both SPEW green blood, scream, die and burst into
	flames. The third, a trucker vampire wearing a cat cap,
	SMACKS Sex Machine in the mouth, which sends the biker for
	a loop.

	As CAT CAP runs toward the fallen Sex Machine, Kate JUMPS
	on his back from behind. Both of them go tumbling into a
	stack of whiskey cases. Sex Machine runs over and grabs Kate
	by the hand, pulling her up and out of the way. Cat Cap is
	lying in a pile of broken bottles and whiskey. Sex Machine
	raises his stake as Cat Cap dies and DRIVES it in the
	vamp's black heart. Cat Cap dies and bursts into flames,
	which hits the whiskey, starting a giant fire.

<b>				SEX MACHINE
</b>		Fire!

	Frost and Jacob stop barricading and run to the fire.

<b>				FROST
</b>			(to Sex Machine)
		We'll put this out. You stake the rest
		of these fuckers.

<b>				SEX MACHINE
</b>		Way ahead of ya.
			(to Kate)
		What's your name, girly?

<b>				KATE
</b>		Kate, what's yours?

<b>				SEX MACHINE
</b>		Sex Machine. Pleased to meet'cha.
		Kate, let's stake these blood-sucker
		fuckers.

	Kate and Sex Machine give each other a high five and go to
	work STAKING the dead bodies.

	Jacob and FROST beat down the fire with their jackets and
	whatever else is at hand.

	A hole begins to appear where a window had been plastered
	over. Little claws scrape their way through. Scott stands
	in front of the window.

<b>				SCOTT
</b>			(yelling)
		We got a problem!

	Seth, who is barricading doors and window, looks in Scott's
	direction. The hole in the plaster cracks open and out POPS
	a little, fleshy vampire bat/rat head. The bat/rat, which is
	SQUEAKING and HISSING its head off, tries to SQUEEZE its
	body through the newly formed hole.

	Seth, gun in hand, RUNS to the window. He points the .45,
	point-blank range at the head of the bat/rat.

	The bat/rat sees this, makes an "oh shit" face, and YANKS
	his head back through the hole.

	Seth was ready to fire, he lowers his gun in bewilderment,
	when...

<b>	WHAM !
</b>
	The bat/rat BURSTS through the hole, like shot out of a
	cannon, HITTING Seth in the gut and sending him FLYING,
	LANDING HARD on his back.

	Once Seth hits the ground, the bat-thing (which has the body
	of a fat rat with a bat's large wingspan) lickity-split
	RUNS UP Seth's body to his juggler. Seth's hand GRABS the
	bat's neck, and tries to PUSH it away. But the bat-thing has
	its CLAWS DUG in Seth's clothes. The bat-thing is just
	inches from Seth's face. Its mouth is SNAPPING.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Get this bastard off of me!

	Frost leaves Jacob with the fire, comes from behind and
	GRABS the bat-thing and YANKS it off of Seth.

	Sex Machine and Kate are a green, bloody mess from their
	preventative staking of dead bodies. Sex Machine kneels by a
	dead body, raising the stake in his hand to spear him. The
	body SPRINGS UP and bites Sex Machine on the arm. Red blood
	squirts all over. Sex Machine screams, then brings the stake
	down in the body's chest. It dies, burns and turns into goo.
	Sex Machine holds his bit arm and wraps it with a piece of
	his shirt. He quickly looks around to see if anybody saw him
	get bit. Nobody saw it, everybody was too busy.

	Frost holds the FLAPPING, FIGHTING, SNAPPING bat-thing in
	front of him at arm's length. He struggles with it for a
	while, then...

	BASHES its head against the bar. The first bash takes some
	fight out of the little fucker, so... Frost BASHES his head
	against the bar six or seven times. He then THROWS the
	bat-thing on the bar, turns it over, garbs a pencil in a
	cup next to the register, and RAMS it in the bat-thing's
	heart. The bat-thing coughs and dies. There's a FLASH of
	FLAMES, followed by a pile of goo.

	Sex Machine and Kate have covered up a hole in the plastered
	window with a table while Frost, Scott and Seth wrestle with
	the bat-thing.

	Jacob has put out the fire. Everybody comes together,
	exhausted, and takes a breather. Outside, the bats continue
	to try and claw their way in.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Is everybody okay?

	Everyone mutters "yeah."

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Okay, does anybody here know what's
		going on?

<b>				SETH
</b>		Yeah, I know what's going on. We got
		a bunch of fuckin' vampires outside
		trying to get inside and suck our
		fuckin' blood! That's it, plain and
		simple. And I don't wanna hear any
		bullshit about "I don't believe in
		vampires" because I don't fuckin'
		believe in vampires either. But I do
		believe in my own two fuckin' eyes,
		and with my two eyes I saw fuckin'
		vampires! Now, does everybody agree
		we're dealin' with vampires.

	Everybody agrees.

<b>				SETH
</b>		You too, preacher?

<b>				JACOB
</b>		I'm like you. I don't believe in
		vampires, but I believe in what I saw.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Good for you. Now, since we all
		believe we're dealing with vampires,
		what do we know about vampires?
		Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a
		cross?

<b>				JACOB
</b>		In the Winnebago.

<b>				SETH
</b>		In other words, no.

<b>				SCOTT
</b>		What are you talking about? We got
		crosses all over the place. All you
		gotta do is put two sticks together
		and you got a cross.

<b>				SEX MACHINE
</b>		He's right. Peter Cushing does that
		all the time.

<b>				SETH
</b>		I don't know about that. In order for
		it to have any power, I think it's
		gotta be an official crucifix.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		What's an official cross? Some piece
		of tin made in Taiwan? What makes that
		official? If a cross works against
		vampires, it's not the cross itself,
		it's what the cross represents. The
		cross is a symbol of holiness.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Okay, I'll buy that. So we got crosses
		covered, moving right along, what
		else?

<b>				FROST
</b>		Wooden stakes in the heart been
		workin' pretty good so far.

<b>				SEX MACHINE
</b>		Garlic, holy water, sunlight... I
		forget, does silver do anything to a
		vampire?

<b>				SCOTT
</b>		That's werewolves.

<b>				SEX MACHINE
</b>		I know silver bullets are werewolves.
		But I'm pretty sure silver has some
		sort of effect on vampires.

<b>				KATE
</b>		Does anybody have any silver?

<b>				ALL
</b>		No.

<b>				KATE
</b>		Then who cares?

<b>				SCOTT
</b>		When's sunrise?

	Jacob looks at his watch.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		About two hours from now.

<b>				KATE
</b>		So all we have to do is get by for a
		few more hours and then we can walk
		right out the front door.

<b>				SEX MACHINE
</b>		Yeah, that's true, but I doubt our
		barricades, that door, those plastered
		windows and these walls will last two
		more hours with those bat fucks
		fuckin' with 'em.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Has anybody here read a real book
		about vampires, or are we just
		remembering what a movie said? I mean
		a real book.

<b>				SEX MACHINE
</b>		You mean like a Time-Life book?

	Everybody laughs.

<b>				FROST
</b>			(in a cowboy voice)
		John Wesley Hardin, so mean he once
		shot a man for snorin'.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		I take it the answer's no. Okay then,
		what do we know about these vampires?

<b>				SETH
</b>		Aside from they're thirsty.

<b>				FROST
</b>		Well, one thing, they might got super
		human strength, but you can hurt 'em.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Yeah, that bottle upside the head of
		Santanico didn't kill her, but it
		didn't feel too good either.

<b>				SEX MACHINE
</b>		Another thing, you try and ram a
		broken chair leg in a human, you
		better be one strong son-of-a-bitch.
		The human body is one rough-tough
		machine. But these vamps got soft
		bodies. The texture of their skin is
		softer, mushier. You can push shit
		right through 'em. Conceivably, if
		you hit one hard enough, you could
		take their fuckin' head off.

<b>				SCOTT
</b>		You could take their head off.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Actually, our best weapon against
		these satanic cocksuckers is this man.
			(he points at Jacob)
		He's a preacher.

	Frost and Sex Machine look toward Jacob.

<b>				SETH
</b>		As far as God's concerned, we might
		just as well be a piece of fuckin'
		shit. But he's one of the boys. Only
		one problem, his faith ain't what it
		used to be.

	Jacob PUNCHES Seth in the mouth, sending him to the floor.
	Jacob stands over him.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		I've had enough of your taunts.

	Seth looks up from the floor.

<b>				SETH
</b>		I'm not taunting you. We need you. A
		faithless preacher doesn't mean shit
		to us. But a man who's a servant of
		God can grab a cross, shove it in
		these monsters' asses. A servant of
		God can bless the tap water and turn
		it into a weapon.

	Seth rises.

<b>				SETH
</b>		I know why you lost your faith. How
		could true holiness exist if your wife
		can be taken away from you and your
		children? Now, I always said God can
		kiss my fuckin' ass. Well, I changed
		my lifetime tune about thirty minutes
		ago' cause I know, without a doubt,
		what's out there trying to get in
		here is pure evil straight from hell.
		And if there is a hell, and those
		monsters are from it, there's got to
		be a heaven. Now which are you, a
		faithless preacher or a mean,
		mother fuckin' servant of God?

	Jacob has to laugh at that. So does everybody else. Jacob
	sticks out his hand and shakes Seth's.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		I'm a mean, mother fucking servant of
		God.

	The laughter and good humor passes quickly and the only
	sound to be heard is that of the bats gnawing and clawing.
	It immediately reminds the group of the deep, deep shit
	they're in.

<b>				KATE
</b>		I don't know if I can take two hours
		of that noise.

<b>				FROST
</b>		You can. You'll take it 'cause ya got
		no choice. How'd ya like twenty four
		hours of it, lying in a muddy ditch
		with only the rotting corpses of your
		friends to keep you company?

<b>				JACOB
</b>		What are you talking about?

<b>				FROST
</b>		Back in '72 I was in Nam, trapped
		behind enemy lines, lying in a rat hole
		with my entire squad dead. They
		thought they killed everybody, and
		except for me, they were right. But it
		wasn't for lack of trying. A grenade
		blew up right next to me, that's why
		I'm so pretty.

	They thought I was dead, so I played dead. They dumped all
	the bodies in a ditch. All I could do was lie there playing
	possum. Dead bodies under me, dead bodies on top of me,
	listening to the enemy laugh and joke hour after hour after
	hour...

	As Frost goes into his monologue, the sound fades out and
	the camera moves to Sex Machine. He's having a hot flash. He
	can't hear anything. He's looking at Frost speaking, but he
	doesn't hear any sound. Then he hears a deep, MALE VOICE
	say:

<b>				MALE VOICE (V.O.)
</b>		Thirst.

	"Who the fuck was that?" he thinks to himself. He turns
	around: nobody's there. No one else in the group seems to
	hear it, A FEMALE VOICE seductively says:

<b>				FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
</b>		Thirst.

	We hear Sex Machine's thought in a voice answer.

<b>				SEX MACHINE (V.O.)
</b>		Stop fucking saying that!

<b>				TWO MALE VOICES (V.O.)
</b>		Thirst!

<b>				SEX MACHINE (V.O.)
</b>		That bite weren't nothin'. It just
		hurt like a son-of-a-bitch, that's
		all. It barely punched the skin.

	Sex Machine looks at Frost, who's acting out his story. The
	biker is pantomiming fighting and slashing. He's describing
	all the while, but we can't hear anything. All we hear are
	many voices, male, female, children saying:

<b>				VOICES (V.O.)
</b>		Thirst... Thirst... Thirst...

	Sex Machine begins looking at the other members of the group
	in a thirsty way. He stares at each of their necks, closer
	and closer until he can see the veins on Frost's neck
	actually pulsating, throbbing, beckoning to him. Sex Machine
	has turned into a vampire.

	The sound comes back as Frost finishes his story.

<b>				FROST
</b>		...and then when I came back to my
		senses, I realized I had killed the
		entire V.C. squadron single handedly.
		My bayonet had blood and chunks of
		yellow flesh on it like some cannibal
		shish kabob. And to this day I don't
		have the slightest idea how I --

	Sex Machine lets out a hideous cry.

<b>				SEX MACHINE
</b><b>		THIRST!
</b>
	Frost SCREAMS as Sex Machine grabs hold of him and BITES
	into his neck.

	The group tries to PULL the TWO men apart.

	Jacob gets his arm around Sex Machine's neck and tries
	pulling.

	Sex Machine takes his teeth out of the biker's neck and
	SINKS them in Jacob's arm.

	Jacob SCREAMS and lets go.

	Seth, Kate and Scott react to Jacob being bit.

	Sex Machine GRABS Jacob and TOSSES him effortlessly over the
	bar, CRASHING into a shelf full of liquor bottles.

	Frost HOPS around the room, mad as a hornet, holding his
	bleeding neck.

<b>				FROST
</b>		I been bit! He fuckin' bit me!

	Sex Machine PUNCHES Seth in the face, dropping him like a
	sack of potatoes.

	He smacks the shit out of Kate. She goes FLYING into a
	table.

	Sex Machine turns, seeing Frost breaking off a big table
	leg. Frost looks at the big vamp.

<b>				FROST
</b>			(to Sex Machine)
		You're dead, mother fucker! You're
		gonna bite me! You just turned me
		into a vampire, asshole!

<b>				SEX MACHINE
</b>		What are you gonna do about it?

	Frost, table leg in hand, RUNS, SCREAMING his head off,
	straight at Sex Machine.

	Sex Machine's nostrils flare. He raises his meaty fist and
	pulls it back, so he can really haul off.

	Frost, top speed, stake raised, screaming. Sex Machine lets
	loose with his punch, Seth, Scott and Kate look up from the
	floor. Jacob rises from behind the bar. Frost's face
	COLLIDES with Sex Machine's fist. Sex Machine hits Frost so
	hard it lifts the biker off the ground and propels him
	through the air.

	Seth sees where Frost is heading and says:

<b>				SETH
</b>		Oh shit!

	Jacob sees.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Good lord!

	Frost, in mid-air, HITS the barricaded, plastered overwindow
	and CRASHES through it.

	Sex Machine lets loose with a maniacal laugh. Hundreds of
	bat-things fly into the bar. Seth grabs the two kids by the
	hand and runs for the backroom.

	Behind the bar, Jacob grabs two pieces of wood from off the
	ground.

	Ten bat-things are in hot pursuit of Seth, Kate and Scott,
	who are RUNNING for their lives. They get to the door of the
	back room, whip it open, dive in and SLAM it behind them. An
	ugly, fleshy bat-thing manges to get its head caught in the
	door as it closes. Kate and Scott PUSH on the door as hard
	as they can. The bat-thing's head, which is inside, screams,
	howls and snaps in fury.

	Seth turns toward the bat/vamp in the door. He sticks his
	.45 in its big mouth.

<b>				SETH
</b>		You wanna suck something, suck on
		this!

	He FIRES four shots that blow the bat vamp's head all over
	the wall.

	Kate yells:

<b>				KATE
</b>		We have to go back for Daddy!

<b>				SETH
</b>		Daddy's dead.

<b>				KATE
</b>		Noooo!

	She spins and grabs the door knob, ready to fling the door
	and help her father. Scott grabs her and pushes her up
	against the wall.

<b>				SCOTT
</b>		He's right, Kate. Daddy's dead! He was
		too far away. If flinging that door
		and filling this room with those
		bat-things would save him, I'd fling
		it. The only thing it'll do is turn us
		into one of them.

<b>				SETH
</b>		He needs our help!

<b>				SCOTT
</b>		He's beyond our help. You saw him get
		bit. I saw him get bit. We all saw it.
		You can't help him. I've got no one
		left to lose but you. I can't be alone
		again. We're sticking together.

	Just then they hear Jacob's voice BOOMING from the bar room.


<b>	INT. BAR ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	Jacob, holding a cross made out of two sticks and reciting
	appropriate verse from the bible, is keeping the vampires at
	bay. But, as Seth predicted, it is the shining power of his
	restored faith that is his mightiest weapon. Jacob is making
	his way through the vampires, toward the back door. A lot of
	the bats have transformed into bat/devil/human creatures.

	The creatures stand at the edge of Jacob's force field of
	holiness. Many bat things fly around the bar like mad,
	whirling dervishes. A cluster of bat-things over above and
	in front of Jacob. They all growl and hiss at the man of
	god. For every one step forward Jacob takes, the vampire
	stake one step back. Jacob recites the verse from the bible
	in a threatening, mean, mother fucking, servant of god tone.
	As he speaks with authority and strength, he sees Frost
	lying on the ground, bat-things on him like ants on a
	candy bar. But Jacob is too much in control to let even this
	repugnant sight trip him up.

	Jacob has backed himself up by the door.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Open the door.

	The door FLIES open. Jacob jumps inside. The door SLAMS
	shut.

	Jacob hugs daughter and son. As he hugs them, we see his
	bloody arm.

	When he releases them, they can't help but notice.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Did he...?

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Yep.

	Seth explodes, knocking over boxes, busting chairs, tipping
	over tables and cussing a blue streak.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Fuck, piss, shit! Mother fuckin'
		vampires! Mother fuckin' vampires!
		Goddamn mother fuckin' vampires!

	Seth runs over to the barricaded door and yells to the
	creatures on the other side.

<b>				SETH
</b>		You all are gonna fuckin' die! I'm
		gonna fuckin' kill every last one of
		you godless pieces of shit!

<b>				JACOB
</b>			(to Seth)
		You bet your sweet ass you are, and
		I'm gonna help you do it. But we ain't
		got much time.

	Kate is crying, she knows what's happened to her father.

<b>				KATE
</b>		You're gonna be okay, aren't you,
		daddy?

<b>				JACOB
</b>		No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect,
		I'm already dead.

	Scott and Kate, crying, grab their father and hold on for
	dear life. Jacob wants to cry, but if he breaks down, the
	kids will never have the courage for what they must do.

<b>				JACOB
</b>			(to his children)
		Children, listen to me. I love you two
		more than anybody. And I just want you 
		to know you've made me proud all your
		lives. But never more so than tonight.
		And I wish we could sit here and cry
		till I pass on, but we can't. Because
		I'm not going to pass on. I'm going to
		turn into a monster. And when I do,
		I'm going to be dangerous. But before
		that happens, just know I love you.
			(to Seth and the kids)
		Now, I'd say in the next twenty or
		thirty minutes our friends outside
		will bust in this door. And I'll
		probably turn into a vampire within
		the hour. Now, you have two choices.
		You can wait for me to turn, then deal
		with me, then wait for them to burst
		inside here and the three of you will
		deal with them. Or, we can kick open
		that door and the four of us can hit
		'em with everything we have, and carve
		a path right through 'em to front
		entrance. But if we're gonna go at 'em,
		we gotta go at 'em now. I confused
		them, I scared them, I took them off
		guard. But they're going to get
		unconfused, they're going to get
		unscared, they're going to get
		together and they're going to hit that
		door like a ton of bricks. And when
		that moment arrives, we gotta be
		ready.

	Jacob sees that the back room is pretty damn big and filled
	with boxes and crates.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		What's this stuff?

<b>				SETH
</b>		My guess is that this little dive's
		been feeding on nomad road waifs like
		bikers and truckers for a longtime.
		This is probably some of the
		shipments they stole off the trucks.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Well, I say lets tear this place apart
		for weapons. So when they burst
		through that door, we'll make 'em wish
		they never did.

<b>				SETH
</b>		I don't give a shit about living or
		dying anymore. I just want to send as
		many of these devils back to hell as
		I can.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Amen.

<b>	MONTAGE
</b>
	The survivors are opening boxes and prying open crates. A
	lot of what they find is bullshit. Pantyhose, coffee,
	teddy bears, etc. But a few of the boxes are just what the
	doctor ordered. Cases from a sporting good supplier yield
	a shipment of baseball bats. Meant to arrive at toy stores
	are a shipment of Uzi replica squirt guns and a box of
	balloons. And captured en route to a hardware store are
	shipments of power tools, saws and jack hammers.

	Seth and Scott saw the bats into wooden stakes.

	Kate fills the Uzi squirt guns with tap water from the
	backroom sink.

	Jacob, with Seth's knife, etches a cross into every bullet
	in the .45 automatic's last full clip of ammo.

	Vampires all start converging on the back room door,
	getting their courage back.

	Kate makes water balloons.

	Scott sharpens the stakes to a point with the tools. Seth
	attaches a wooden stake to the end of a jackhammer.

	Jacob blesses the water in the squirt guns and balloons,
	turning it into holy water.

	Our heroes work together, preparing for the battle to come.
	The back room door, barricaded with crates and boxes,
	begins to be pounded on by the undead on the other side.
	The room tone is a combination of chewing, scratching,
	pounding, squeaking and screaming.

	Finally they're ready.

	Jacob turns to his kids.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Before we go any further, I need you
		three to promise me something. I'll
		fight with you to the bitter end,
		but when I turn into one of them, I
		won't be Jacob anymore. I'll be a
		lap dog of Satan. I want you three to
		promise you'll take me down, no
		different from the rest.

	The kids can't say the words.

<b>				SETH
</b>		I promise.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Kate, Scott?

<b>				KATE
</b>		I promise.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Scott?

<b>				SCOTT
</b>		Yeah, I promise.

	Jacob doesn't believe them.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Why don't I believe you?
			(he picks up the .45)
		I'm gonna ask you two again, then I
		want you to swear to God that you'll
		kill me. If you don't, I'm gonna
		just kill myself right now. Now,
		since you need me I think you better
		swear. Kate, do you swear to God
		that when I turn into one of the
		undead, you'll kill me?

	Kate doesn't answer. Jacob places the .45 barrel against his
	temple.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Kate, we don't have all day, so I'm
		only gonna count to five. One...two...
		three... four...

<b>				KATE
</b>		Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Not good enough, swear to God.

<b>				KATE
</b>		I swear to God, our father, that when
		you change into one of the undead, I
		will kill you.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Good girl. Now, Scott, we have even
		less time, so I'm only giving you the
		count of three. One...

<b>				SCOTT
</b>		You don't believe in suicide.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		It's not suicide if you're already
		dead. Two...

<b>				SCOTT
</b>		Okay, I'll kill you when you change,
		I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name.

<b>				JACOB
</b>		Thank you, son.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Okay, vampire killers, let's kill some
		fuckin' vampires.


<b>	INT. BARROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	The vampires, bat-things and what have you, start BREAKING
	down the door. They are in a mad frenzy. They burst through
	the door.

	Waiting for them are Scott and Kate holding Uzi squirt guns
	and water balloons draped down their chests on a belt like
	grenades. Jacob is holding a cross made of sharp wooden
	stakes and the .45 with the cross bullets. Seth is holding
	the jackhammer. The survivors walk out of the back room
	into the bar. The vamps back up, letting them inside.

	What we have here is a Mexican standoff, a la "The Wild
	Bunch." A moment of peace before the battle. The vamps just
	watch the humans. The humans just watch the vamps. Then,
	like the bull in the china shop, Seth ends the peace by
	starting up the jackhammer.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Kill 'em all!

	Jacob holds up the cross, the vamps react.

	The kids SPRAY the crowd with UZI fire, burning vampire
	flesh.

	The pack of vamps retreat while the Fuller squad walk
	forward.

	They are attacked on all sides, but they keep moving towards
	the door.

	Seth slams the stakes into several of the vamps, it speeds
	in and out of vampire chests, each time spraying him in
	green vamp blood.

	Jacob shoves his cross stake into a vampire with one hand
	and SHOOTS three vampires with blessed bullets with the
	other.

	Flame BURSTS from the vampires' chests when the bullets hit.

	Kate and Scott both whip water balloons off their belts and
	toss them into the crowd.

	They burst and FRY several of the vamps, who fall, screaming
	in pain.

	From its perch on a wood ceiling beam, a bat-thing drops and
	HURLS toward the group.

	Jacob sees it, raises his gun and FIRES.

	The bat-thing bursts into a ball of screaming fire.

	Seth continues carving a path to the front door by slamming
	the hammer stake into vampire chests.

	The front door is barricaded again by a big table and other
	junk.

<b>				SCOTT
</b>			(yelling)
		Why did they block the door again?

<b>				JACOB
</b>			(yelling)
		To keep the daylight out! This is
		where they sleep! Get to the door!

	Seth tries to get to the front door, when Sex Machine, now a
	half bat, half devil vamp, about six foot seven, drops from
	above in front of him. Seth RAMS the stake in its chest. The
	Sex Machine-thing screams out, LIFTING the hammer and Seth
	off the ground.

	Seth is thrown from his hold on the hammer across the room,
	he CRASHES into a table.

	The Sex Machine-thing falls back with the jackhammer
	sticking out of his chest, dead.

	Kate, spraying Uzi fire like Rambo, sees Seth fall. She
	screams:

<b>				KATE
</b>		Seth!

	Seth quickly gets up to find himself surrounded by vampires
	on all sides. With no weapons, he puts up on dukes.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Okay, dead boys, come on! Take a bite
		and feel all right!

	Kate clusters with her father and Scott.

<b>				KATE
</b>			(yelling)
		I'm going for 'em!

<b>				JACOB
</b>		No!

<b>				KATE
</b>		Everybody goes home!

	Kate turns into a squirt gun firing, water-balloon throwing,
	one-woman army, as she breaks from her father and heads in
	Seth's direction.

<b>				KATE
</b>			(screaming)
		Die, monster, die! Die, monster, die!

	Kate mows down the group by Seth, they lie on the floor,
	burning in agony. Kate takes Seth's hand and gives him a
	couple of water balloons and a stake.

<b>				KATE
</b>			(to Seth)
		Watch my back!

<b>				SETH
</b>		Anytime.

	Cutting through vampires, the two make their way across the
	bar.

	Jacob, firing the .45, takes out several more vampires in
	fiery death.

	Scott fires the Uzi and chucks more water balloons.

	As Jacob fights, all of a sudden the sound goes out. He
	can't hear anything. He wonders if he's gone deaf. He starts
	to hear the words: "Thirst, thirst, thirst." He notices the
	vampires have stopped attacking him. They look at him wit
	happy smiles on their devilish faces. Fangs begin to grow.
	His eyes are yellow.

	Scott turns to his dad. He sees his father is a monster.

	Jacob, with a devilish grin on his face, GRABS Scott and
	sinks his teeth into Scott's forearm. Scott screams bloody
	murder as his dad begins to drain him of blood.

	Scott takes one of the water balloons he's wearing and
	SMASHES it against Jacob's head.

	The holy water melts half of Jacob's face away. He lets go
	of Scott, screaming, and drops the .45 on the floor.

	Scott drops to the ground, picking up the gun. He brings it
	up to fire.

	A totally evil Jacob, with only half a face, matches stares
	with the boy he once called his son.

	Scott's eyes turn to steel.

<b>				SCOTT
</b>		I swear to God, in Jesus Christ's
		name.

	He FIRES, sending a holy bullet into Jacob's forehead,
	creating a hole from which fire shoots out. Jacob's entire
	head bursts into flames, then explodes.

	From across the room, Fate sees her daddy ignite. She
	cries out. In the thick of the battle, Seth yells:

<b>				SETH
</b>		Fight now, cry later.

	Kate takes his advice and hits a vamp square in the face
	with a holy water balloon, which melts his head.

	A bat-thing lands on the back of Scott's neck. He screams as
	it bites into him. He drops the .45.

	Kate sees Scott get bit.

<b>				KATE
</b>		Oh my god.

	Another bat-thing lands on Scott's arm and takes a bite.
	Scott screams.

<b>				KATE
</b>		You bastards!

	She goes to spray them when her Uzi runs out of water.

	Now seven bat-things are on Scott biting and sucking blood.
	Scott is in agony.

<b>				SCOTT
</b>		Kill me, Kate! 

	Kate runs for her brother, does a DIVE and a ROLL, coming
	up by the .45, SNATCHING it in one motion and FIRING three
	times.

	One... two... three bat-things are hit, shoot flames, then
	all of them EXPLODE, BLOWING UP Scott.

	The remaining vamps approach.

	All the humans have left is a few bullets and one holy
	balloon.

<b>				SETH
</b>		How many bullets left, kid?

<b>				KATE
</b>		Not many.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Well, when you run out of weapons,
		just start cold cocking 'em. Make 'em
		sing for their supper.

	The two survivors are backed up against a wall. Two bat
	things do a Kamikaze dive from the air toward Seth. Seth
	throws the holy balloon at them. Direct hit. The two
	bat-things burst into flames and spiral to the floor.

	The two survivors look at the vampires, who stand before
	them. A moment of stillness before the attack. Kate stands
	holding the .45, arm outstretched.

<b>				KATE
</b>			(to Seth)
		Should I use the last bullets on us?

<b>				SETH
</b>		You use 'em on the first couple of
		these parasites that try to bite you.

	The vamps begins to close in. Kate lines up the .45 sights
	on the face of an approaching vampire.

	Seth holds the Uzi like a club, ready to bash in the first
	vampire's head that gets in swinging distance.

	Beams of sunlight shoot through the holes that Kate shot
	through the wall. Approaching vampires burn. The scorched
	vamps scream like they've never screamed before.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Shoot more holes!

	Kate turns away from the vamps and shoots holes in the wall
	behind him, Daylight comes through, providing Kate and
	Seth with a safe, lighted area.

	The .45's empty.

	The vamps hiss and scream at the frustration of not being
	able to get at them.

	The two survivors hold hands, when...

	All of a sudden the door to the Titty Twister is pounded on
	from the outside.

	The vamps look towards it in horror.

	From the other side of the door, we hear a voice with a
	Spanish accent.

<b>				VOICE (O.S.)
</b>			(in Spanish)
		I'm looking for my friend. Is Seth in
		there?

<b>				SETH
</b>			(yelling)
		Carlos!
			(in Spanish)
		Help us, bash the door. Bash the door
		in!

<b>				CARLOS (O.S.)
</b>			(in Spanish)
		Danny, Manny, knock down the door.
		Hurry, hurry!

	The vamps are totally fucking freaked out! They run and fly
	around the bar in a panic. Crying, howling, grabbing onto
	each other.

	The front door is TORN apart from shotgun fir coming from
	the outside, punching holes the size of basketballs in the
	door.

	The table in front of the door gives and FALLS forward.

	The door caves in and sunlight invades the bar. Many vamps
	are instantly fried, bursting into flames.

	The Mexican gangster CARLSO and his two henchmen, DANNY and
	MANNY, are horrified at what they see. They cross themselves
	in fright.

	Vampires search for dark corners, but all is lost. Sunlight
	hits a mirrored ball attached to the ceiling, sending
	hundreds of beams of sunlight scattering through the room.
	Vamps try and dodge the beams. No dice. All around the vamps
	combust in fiery explosions.

	The Titty Twister is now on fire, burning out of control.

	Seth and Kate run through the building and leap through the
	door into the parking lot.


<b>	EXT. TITTY TWISTER PARKING LOT - MORNING
</b>
	Carlos, Danny and Manny help them to their feet and walk
	them away from the blazing bar. They catch their breath by
	Carlos's Mercedes.

<b>				CARLOS
</b>			(to Seth)
		What the fuck was going on in there?

	Seth signals Carlos to wait a minute while he catches his
	breath. Then he hauls off and PUNCHES Carlos square in the
	kisser. Danny and Manny aim their shotguns at Seth.

<b>				CARLOS
</b>			(in Spanish)
		Whatsamatter with you? Are you crazy?

<b>				SETH
</b>		Why the fuck, outta all the god
		forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you
		have us rendezvous at that place?

<b>				CARLOS
</b>		I don't know, one place's as good as
		another.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Have you ever been there before?

<b>				CARLOS
</b>		No, but I passed by it a couple of
		times. It's out in the middle of
		nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place,
		so there wouldn't be a lot of police.
		And it's open from dusk till dawn.
		You said meet you in the morning.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Well, because you picked that place
		out of a hat, my brother's dead now.
		And this girl's family's dead.

	Carlos stands up again.

<b>				CARLOS
</b>		I'm sorry to hear that. What were
		they, psychos?

<b>				SETH
</b>		Did they look like psychos? They
		were fuckin' vampires. Psychos don't
		explode when sunlight hits 'em, I
		don't care how crazy they are.

	Danny and Manny react to the vampire news by crossing
	themselves again.

<b>				CARLOS
</b>		Oh, Seth, how can I ever make it up
		to you?

<b>				SETH
</b>		You can't, but fifteen percent instead
		of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a
		good start.

<b>				CARLOS
</b>		Twenty-eight.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Jesus Christ, Carlos, my brother's
		dead and he's not coming back, and
		it's all your fault. Twenty.


	They look at each other, then shake hands, saying in unison.

<b>				SETH AND CARLOS
</b>			(in Spanish)
		Twenty-five.

	Seth gets the suitcase and gives Carlos 25%. Seth walks over
	to a red 1990 Porsche 911.


<b>				CARLOS
</b>		You like the car?

<b>				SETH
</b>		I said new, this is an '90.

<b>				CARLOS
</b>		It's hardly been used at all. I got it
		from a drug dealer who only drove it 5
		times in as many years. Swear to God.
		That's like new.

<b>				SETH
</b>		So do I just follow you?

<b>				CARLOS
</b>		Yeah, follow us.


<b>				SETH
</b>		So let's do it.

<b>				CARLOS
</b>			(to Danny and Manny)
		Vamanos!

	Carlos, Danny and Manny pile into Carlo's white Mercedes.

	Seth by his Porsche, looks back at Kate.

	Kate stands alone.

	The whole desert seems between them.

	So much to say ... but no words.

<b>				SETH
</b>		I'm sorry.

<b>				KATE
</b>		Me too.

	Long pause.

<b>				SETH
</b>		See ya.

<b>				KATE
</b>		Later.

	Seth turns his back on her. Just as he opens the door, Kate
	says behind him:

<b>				KATE (O.S.)
</b>		Seth.

	Seth turns around.

<b>				KATE
</b>		You want some company?

	Seth smiles.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Kate honey, I may be a bastard. But
		I'm not a fuckin' bastard.

	He blows her a kiss across the desert.

	She blows one back.

	Seth's in his car and GONE.

	Kate turns around, faces endless desert before her, and
	begins her long walk home.
